It became extinct due to climate change and human predation.\n   - **Unique Feature:** Large skulls with high foreheads, indicative of plant-heavy diets.\n\n2. **Giant Short-Faced Bear (*Arctodus simus*)**\n   - **Era:** Pleistocene (~2.5 million to 11,000 years ago)\n   - **Habitat:** North America\n   - **Description:** One of the largest terrestrial carnivorous mammals ever, adapted for scavenging or running.\n   - **Extinction Cause:** Likely due to declining prey availability and competition with humans.\n\n3. **Atlas Bear (*Ursus arctos crowtheri*)**\n   - **Era:** Holocene (~19th century extinction)\n   - **Habitat:** North Africa\n   - **Description:** The only bear native to Africa, it was a brown bear subspecies.\n   - **Extinction Cause:** Overhunting by humans.\n\n4. **Deninger\u2019s Bear (*Ursus deningeri*)**\n   - **Era:** Middle Pleistocene (1.8 million to 100,000 years ago)\n   - **Habitat:** Europe\n   - **Description:** Considered an evolutionary precursor to the Cave Bear.\n\n5. **Florida Cave Bear (*Tremarctos floridanus*)**\n   - **Era:** Late Pleistocene (2.5 million to 11,000 years ago)\n   - **Habitat:** North America\n   - **Description:** A smaller member of the short-faced bears, and a relative of the modern Spectacled Bear (*Tremarctos ornatus*).\n\n6. **Auvergne Bear (*Ursus minimus*)**\n   - **Era:** Pliocene (5 to 2 million years ago)\n   - **Habitat:** Europe\n   - **Description:** One of the earliest species of the genus *Ursus*, believed to be an ancestor of modern brown and black bears.\n\n7. **Agriotherium**\n   - **Era:** Late Miocene to Pleistocene (~9 to 2.5 million years ago)\n   - **Habitat:** Found in Africa, Eurasia, and North America\n   - **Description:** A massive bear with a hypercarnivorous diet, likely transitioning toward omnivory.\n\n8. **Kolponomos**\n   - **Era:** Miocene (~20 to 15 million years ago)\n   - **Habitat:** North America\n   - **Description:** Marine-adapted bears with traits similar to otters, showing unique evolutionary experimentation among bears.\n\n9. **Protarctos**\n   - **Era:** Pliocene (~3 to 2 million years ago)\n   - **Habitat:** Arctic regions\n   - **Description:** A potential ancestor to the polar bear, adapting early to cold climates.\n\n10. **Giant Panda Relatives (*Ailuropodinae*)**\n    - **Era:** Miocene (~20 million years ago)\n    - **Habitat:** Eurasia\n    - **Description:** Distant relatives of modern giant pandas, deviating from a largely carnivorous lineage to adopt specialized plant diets.\n\n---\n\n### Evolutionary Insights:\n- Bears emerged from dog-like ancestors roughly 20 million years ago, diversifying into omnivorous, carnivorous, and herbivorous species.\n- Climate shifts, habitat loss, and human activities played significant roles in the extinction of many prehistoric bear species.\n\nWould you like further details on a specific bear species or its evolutionary path?", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 282, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 6464, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 311, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 8174, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 313, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 8671}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2873, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 3709, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 3953}, "total_time": [142.84983706474304], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [3.879685878753662, 90.88682913780212], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.7012529373168945], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [6.056755065917969], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [20.73157811164856]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1922, 4499], "completion": [219, 821], "total": [2141, 5320]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [104], "completion": [553], "total": [657]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [79], "completion": [845], "total": [924]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [76], "completion": [822], "total": [898]}}}

Production Process and Quality**\n- **Cattle Breed**: Kobe beef comes exclusively from the Tajima strain of Japanese Black cattle, known for its genetic predisposition to produce high levels of intramuscular fat or marbling.\n- **Strict Care Standards**: The cattle benefit from extraordinary care, including stress reduction techniques such as regular massages and feeding regimens that often include beer and sake to improve digestion.\n- **Rigorous Quality Control**: This beef is graded based on marbling, meat quality, texture, and color. Only the finest cuts are certified Kobe beef, supervised by the Kobe Beef Marketing & Distribution Promotion Association.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Rarity and Demand**\n- **Small-Scale Production**: Only cattle raised in Hyogo Prefecture in Japan under strict guidelines can qualify as \"Kobe beef.\" This limitation drastically reduces availability.\n- **High Global Demand**: Kobe beef is highly sought after in upscale restaurants worldwide due to its unmatched tenderness and flavor.\n- **Export Restrictions**: Japan maintains strict export policies to preserve the exclusivity and reputation of Kobe beef. This limited supply adds to its allure and price globally.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Economic and Logistics Factors**\n- **Cost-Intensive Rearing**: Raising Kobe cattle involves significant investment in specialized feed, healthcare, and labor, increasing production costs.\n- **Supply Chain Costs**: Kobe beef requires precise handling and cold-chain logistics to ensure quality during transportation. High tariffs and fees for certification further inflate costs.\n- **Premium Branding**: Kobe beef enjoys global prestige as a luxury product, allowing producers to command higher prices.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nKobe beef's high price is due to a combination of meticulous production methods, unparalleled quality, limited availability, intense global demand, and economic challenges such as logistics and certification costs. Its reputation as a culinary delicacy ensures its position as one of the most expensive meats worldwide.\n\nLet me know if you need further details!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 264, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 8262, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 264, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 7919, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 280, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 5362}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 3781, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 3605, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2315}, "total_time": [53.18233299255371], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.723040819168091, 10.67006802558899], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [6.947443962097168], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [7.838004112243652], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [14.176193952560425]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1920, 3766], "completion": [205, 412], "total": [2125, 4178]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [100], "completion": [625], "total": [725]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [74], "completion": [566], "total": [640]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [72], "completion": [350], "total": [422]}}}

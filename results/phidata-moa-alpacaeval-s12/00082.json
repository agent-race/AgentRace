Here\u2019s how you can set up a suitable environment:\n\n1. **Cage Requirements**:\n   - **Size**: A spacious cage is essential (minimum 24 x 12 x 12 inches for 1-2 rats).\n   - **Material**: Use metal or plastic cages with bars spaced no more than 1 inch apart.\n   - **Ventilation**: Ensure good air circulation to minimize ammonia buildup.\n   \n2. **Bedding**:\n   - Use paper-based bedding, wood shavings, or fleece (avoid pine and cedar, as these are toxic).\n   - Bedding should be 2-3 inches deep to allow burrowing.\n\n3. **Accessories**:\n   - Tunnels, tubes, climbing structures, ladders, and chew toys for enrichment.\n   - Hiding spots (boxes, small houses) for comfort.\n\n4. **Cleaning**:\n   - **Daily**: Remove soiled bedding and wash food/water dishes.\n   - **Weekly**: Replace all bedding and clean the litter box.\n   - **Deep Cleaning**: Every 2-3 months, disinfect the cage and its accessories.\n\n5. **Environment**:\n   - Maintain a stable temperature of 65-75\u00b0F (18-24\u00b0C) and moderate humidity (50-60%).\n   - Keep the cage in a quiet area with minimal noise and distraction.\n\n---\n\n### **Feeding Your Pet Rat**\nNutrition plays a massive role in your rat's health. Here\u2019s what to feed them:\n\n1. **Primary Diet**:\n   - **Rat Pellets**: These should make up about 80% of their diet. Feed 1-2 tablespoons twice daily.\n\n2. **Fresh Foods**:\n   - **Vegetables**: Broccoli, carrots, bell peppers, and leafy greens. Offer a small handful (1-2 tablespoons daily).\n   - **Fruits**: Apples, berries, and bananas. Use sparingly (1-2 tablespoons a few times per week).\n\n3. **Occasional Treats**:\n   - Seeds, nuts, or commercial rat treats (1-2 per week).\n\n4. **Foods to Avoid**:\n   - Sugary or salty snacks.\n   - Dairy products (rats are lactose-intolerant).\n   - Raw or uncooked foods like meat or eggs.\n   - Citrus fruits (can harm male rats).\n\n---\n\n### **General Rat Care**\nBeyond food and housing, rats require socialization, healthcare, and mental stimulation:\n\n1. **Socialization and Handling**:\n   - Rats are social and should not live alone. Keep them in same-sex pairs or groups.\n   - Spend at least 1-2 hours daily bonding. Gently handle your rat to build trust and provide supervised playtime.\n\n2. **Mental Enrichment**:\n   - Use puzzle toys, treat dispensers, climbing ropes, and cardboard mazes.\n   - Train your rat to learn tricks (like fetching or spinning) using positive reinforcement (treats).\n\n3. **Health and Well-Being**:\n   - Regular **vet visits** (find a vet specializing in exotic pets).\n   - Watch for common issues like **respiratory infections**, **tumors**, or parasites. Seek care promptly if your rat shows lethargy, sneezing, or unusual lumps.\n   - Lifespan: Rats live 2-3 years when properly cared for.\n\n4. **Attention**:\n   - Rats crave interaction, so dedicate daily time for play, observation, and affectionate handling. This keeps them engaged and healthy.\n\n---\n\nBy following this guide, your pet rat will thrive, live happily, and enjoy a healthy life.

Historical accounts note that \"wildfowl\" was served, which could have included turkey, but venison and other local foods were more prominent. Despite common misconceptions, there's no definitive evidence that turkey was the centerpiece.\n\n2. **Domestication and Availability**:\n   - Wild turkeys were native to North America and widely abundant. Their size made them suitable for feeding large groups of people, aligning with the communal spirit of Thanksgiving.\n\n3. **Early Traditions**:\n   - By the 19th century, turkey had become a practical and affordable choice for American families during harvest feasts. Its large size made it ideal for community gatherings.\n\n---\n\n### **Cultural Influence**\n1. **Literary Promotion**:\n   - Sarah Josepha Hale\u2019s novel *Northwood* (1827) detailed a Thanksgiving meal featuring roasted turkey. As a writer and advocate for Thanksgiving becoming a national holiday, her descriptions played a significant role in popularizing the turkey as the Thanksgiving centerpiece.\n\n2. **National Holiday**:\n   - When Abraham Lincoln made Thanksgiving a national holiday in 1863, the turkey's association with the feast was further cemented in American tradition.\n\n3. **Visual Representation**:\n   - Artwork and literature often depicted Thanksgiving feasts featuring turkey, reinforcing its symbolic association with themes of abundance and gratitude.\n\n---\n\n### **Practical and Commercial Reasons**\n1. **Symbol of Abundance**:\n   - Turkeys came to represent prosperity, making them an ideal symbol for Thanksgiving's focus on gratitude and harvest.\n\n2. **Economic Factors**:\n   - Turkeys were accessible and affordable due to their prevalence in the United States. They became a practical centerpiece for large meals.\n\n3. **Marketing**:\n   - Poultry farmers and commercial advertisers heavily promoted turkey in the mid-20th century, further solidifying its role in Thanksgiving celebrations.\n\n---\n\n### **Myths and Misconceptions**\n- While the belief that turkey was present at the first Thanksgiving persists, historical accounts only confirm \"fowl,\" which could have included other birds. Artistic depictions and popular literature shaped the modern narrative of turkey as the main dish.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe turkey\u2019s status as the official food of Thanksgiving is a product of history, cultural symbolism, and practicality. Although its role in the \"first Thanksgiving\" is uncertain, its association with themes of abundance, gratitude, and tradition has made it integral to the holiday.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need further clarification on any aspect!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 265, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 7867, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 271, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 8472, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 327, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 6973}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 3583, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 3878, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 3097}, "total_time": [59.76582908630371], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [14.85600209236145, 8.304870128631592], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [8.345813035964966], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.067140817642212], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [13.930495977401733]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1924, 4009], "completion": [211, 592], "total": [2135, 4601]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [98], "completion": [563], "total": [661]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [77], "completion": [667], "total": [744]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [75], "completion": [511], "total": [586]}}}

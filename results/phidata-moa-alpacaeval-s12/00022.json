Incorporating sand, perlite, pumice, or gravel improves porosity and drainage capabilities.\n\n2. **Nutrient and pH Levels:**\n   - **Low Nutrient Content:** Cacti naturally thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It's important to minimize organic matter to avoid excess moisture retention that can harm cacti.\n   - **Slightly Acidic to Neutral pH:** A pH range of 6.0 to 7.5 is optimal for most cacti, facilitating nutrient absorption without causing stress.\n\n3. **Water Retention and Aeration:**\n   - **Moderate Water Retention:** While excellent drainage is crucial, some moisture retention is necessary to sustain the cactus. Small amounts of peat moss or coconut coir can help.\n   - **Good Aeration:** Proper soil aeration ensures oxygen availability to root systems, promoting healthy plant growth.\n\n#### Recommended Soil Composition:\n- **Sand:** 50-70% for its drainage properties.\n- **Perlite/Vermiculite/Pumice:** 10-20% for enhanced aeration and drainage.\n- **Peat Moss/Coconut Coir:** 10-20% to retain moisture and provide minimal nutrients.\n- **Compost/Worm Castings:** 5-10% for additional organic structure and slight nutrient content.\n\n#### Practical Tips:\n- **DIY Soil Mix:** Combine 2 parts sand, 1 part perlite or pumice, 1 part peat moss or coconut coir, and 0.5 parts compost.\n- **Specialized Product Options:** Look for pre-made \"cactus & succulent soil\" mixes, tested for optimal drainage and composition.\n- **Avoid Moisture-Retentive Additives:** Be wary of vermiculite or excessive use of peat moss in mixes.\n- **Sterilization:** To prevent pests and diseases, consider sterilizing soil by baking at a low temperature.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can guarantee a conducive environment for your cacti, supporting their growth and ensuring their health in both indoor and outdoor settings. \ud83c\udf35", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 286, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 5956, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 258, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 6471, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 319, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 5503}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2617, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2884, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2366}, "total_time": [60.197591066360474], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [6.360869884490967, 7.805813789367676], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [7.529851913452148], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.426754951477051], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [25.31604814529419]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1920, 3727], "completion": [211, 495], "total": [2131, 4222]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [106], "completion": [490], "total": [596]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [77], "completion": [538], "total": [615]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [74], "completion": [427], "total": [501]}}}

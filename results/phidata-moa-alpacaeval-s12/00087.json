{"query": "instruction: Hi, I'd like to play ice hockey. Can you explain how the game works?", "answer": "Sure! Ice hockey is a team sport played on ice. It is usually played between two teams of six players each, but can also be played with fewer players. The objective of the game is to score goals by shooting a hard rubber puck into the opposing team's net. Players attempt to control the puck using a hockey stick and can pass it to teammates or take shots at the goal. The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins.", "result": "\nRunning:\n - transfer_task_to_chat_agent_1(task_description=Provide an overview of how ice hockey is played., expected_output=..., additional_information=...)\n - transfer_task_to_chat_agent_2(task_description=Explain the roles and positions in an ice hockey team., expected_output=..., additional_information=...)\n - transfer_task_to_chat_agent_3(task_description=Describe the equipment used in ice hockey., expected_output=..., additional_information=Players use various pieces of equipment to ensure protection and facilitate gameplay.)\n\nHere is a complete overview of how ice hockey works, including gameplay, player roles, and the required equipment:\n\n---\n\n### **How Ice Hockey Works**\nIce hockey is a fast-paced, physical sport played on ice. Two teams compete to score goals by hitting a puck into the opponent's net using hockey sticks. The game demands teamwork, strategy, and skill.\n\n#### **Objective of the Game**\nThe aim is to score more goals than the opposing team by the end of the match. Goals are scored when the puck completely crosses the goal line between the goalposts.\n\n#### **Basic Rules**\n- The game is divided into **three periods of 20 minutes each**, with intermissions in between.\n- A **face-off** starts the game and resumes play after stoppages.\n- Players must avoid going **offside** (entering the attacking zone before the puck) and shooting from behind their blue line without the puck reaching anyone (**icing**).\n- **Penalties** are given for rule violations, resulting in a player serving time in the penalty box, leaving their team shorthanded on the ice.\n\n---\n\n### **Roles and Positions**\nIce hockey teams consist of up to six players on the ice at a time: three forwards, two defensemen, and one goaltender. Each position plays a specific part:\n\n- **Forwards:**\n  - **Center:** Plays in the middle and helps with puck distribution and face-offs.\n  - **Wingers (Left Wing and Right Wing):** Positioned on either side of the center, focusing on offensive plays and scoring.\n\n- **Defensemen:**\n  - Protect their goal by blocking opponents and clearing the puck.\n  - Also contribute to offensive plays by passing to forwards.\n\n- **Goaltender (Goalie):**\n  - The last line of defense, preventing the puck from entering the goal. A goalie relies on reflexes, positioning, and communication with teammates.\n\n---\n\n### **Equipment Used**\nPlayers require specialized gear for safety and performance:\n\n#### **General Gear**\n- **Ice Skates:** Allow players to glide and maneuver on the ice.\n- **Hockey Stick:** Used to shoot, pass, and control the puck.\n- **Padded Gloves:** Protect hands and improve grip on the stick.\n- **Helmet and Face Shield:** Prevent head injuries and facial damage.\n- **Shin Guards, Shoulder Pads, and Elbow Pads:** Protect against impacts and falls.\n- **Mouthguard:** Protects teeth and reduces concussion risks.\n\n#### **Goalie-Specific Equipment**\n- Larger **leg pads, chest protectors, and gloves** better suited for blocking.\n- **Goalie mask:** Provides extra protection for the head and face.\n\n---\n\nIce hockey is an exciting and engaging sport that combines skill, speed, and strategy.

These movements are key in the formation of volcanoes:\n\n- **Divergent Boundaries**: Here, plates move apart, allowing magma to rise and create new crust. This occurs at mid-ocean ridges, producing volcanic activity as new crust forms.\n- **Convergent Boundaries (Subduction Zones)**: One plate is pushed under another, leading to melting and magma formation as the subducted plate heats up. The magma rises to create volcanic arcs.\n- **Transform Boundaries**: Plates slide past each other without creating volcanoes.\n\n### Magma Formation\nMagma is formed through several processes:\n\n- **Decompression Melting**: Occurs when pressure decreases as rocks move upwards, lowering the melting point and forming magma.\n- **Introduction of Water**: Water from subducted plates facilitates melting by decreasing rock melting points.\n- **Temperature Increase**: Heat is generated from the Earth's interior through radioactive decay, friction, and hot mantle plumes.\n\n### Eruption Processes and Types of Volcanoes\nOnce magma forms, it accumulates beneath the Earth's surface and eventually leads to volcanic eruptions driven by buoyancy and gas pressure:\n\n- **Shield Volcanoes**: Formed by fluid lava flows creating gentle slopes.\n- **Stratovolcanoes**: Known for explosive eruptions from viscous lava that builds steep profiles.\n- **Cinder Cones**: Result from accumulations of ash and cinders from smaller eruptions.\n\n### Conclusion\nVolcanoes are a result of complex interactions involving tectonic plates' movements, magma formation, and eruption processes. Understanding these elements is crucial for volcano prediction and associated risk management.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 300, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 7688, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 264, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 6277, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 252, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 4836}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 3476, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2784, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2066}, "total_time": [70.98145294189453], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [6.633584022521973, 18.71771502494812], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [11.205241918563843], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.49849009513855], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [12.919786930084229]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1919, 3631], "completion": [216, 427], "total": [2135, 4058]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [105], "completion": [605], "total": [710]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [87], "completion": [462], "total": [549]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [66], "completion": [336], "total": [402]}}}

Select a thread that matches your shirt color to blend seamlessly. If you're new to this, you can opt for a contrasting thread for visibility.\n2. Cut a piece of thread (about 12-24 inches).\n3. Thread the needle and pull the ends together, doubling the thread. Tie a small, secure knot at the end.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Mark and Align the Button**\n1. If replacing an old button, use the existing stitch marks as a reference.\n2. For a new button, align the button with the corresponding buttonhole and mark its position using a fabric marker, chalk, or pin.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Start Sewing**\n- **For 2-Hole Buttons:**\n  1. Insert the needle from the underside of the fabric and pull it through one hole of the button.\n  2. Pass the needle into the second hole and pull tight. Repeat this process around **4-8 times**, ensuring the button is securely attached but not overly tight.\n  \n- **For 4-Hole Buttons:**\n  1. Follow the above steps, sewing either in a criss-cross (\u201cX\u201d) pattern or a parallel line pattern for even tension. Ensure stitches are uniform across all four holes.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4: Create Slack for Buttoning (Optional)**\n- Insert a toothpick or matchstick under the button while sewing to create a small gap, ensuring enough slack for easy buttoning.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 5: Secure the Button**\n1. Once the button is securely attached, push the needle up under the button but **not through the fabric**.\n2. Wrap the thread around the base (under the button) a few times to create a reinforced \u201cshank.\u201d This adds durability and flexibility for buttoning.\n3. Push the needle back through and tie a knot on the underside of the shirt for extra security.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 6: Final Steps**\n1. Trim excess thread close to the knot with scissors.\n2. Test the button by gently tugging to ensure it\u2019s secure.\n3. Iron the fabric lightly to remove any creases or puckering caused during the sewing process.\n\n---\n\n### **Tips and Troubleshooting**\n- Use a thimble to protect your fingers while pushing the needle through thicker fabrics.\n- Add extra stitches for heavier fabrics or buttons that see frequent use.\n- For a cleaner look, consider using a small backing button on the underside of the shirt to reinforce the stitches.\n\n---\n\nWould you need illustrations or visuals to accompany these steps or other detailed support? \ud83d\ude0a", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 307, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 9403, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 333, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 9120, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 316, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 8196}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 4330, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 4171, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 3714}, "total_time": [119.81555604934692], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.947329998016357, 64.3658459186554], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [8.88649296760559], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.321712970733643], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [25.412183046340942]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1926, 4791], "completion": [239, 634], "total": [2165, 5425]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [112], "completion": [806], "total": [918]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [93], "completion": [805], "total": [898]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [73], "completion": [762], "total": [835]}}}

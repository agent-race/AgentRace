{"query": "instruction: I want to learn more about airplanes. How were they created?", "answer": "The invention of the airplane is credited to two brothers, Orville and Wilbur Wright, who are often referred to as the Wright Brothers. The Wright Brothers flew the first powered airplane on December 17, 1903. The plane flew for 12 seconds and covered 120 feet. The brothers used a four-cylinder gasoline engine to power the aircraft. The engine was designed by Charles Taylor, a machinist who worked for the brothers. The Wright brothers continued to make improvements to their design, eventually creating a plane that could fly for more than 30 minutes.", "result": "\nRunning:\n - transfer_task_to_chat_agent_1(task_description=Explain the creation and evolution of airplanes., expected_output=A detailed explanation about how airplanes were created and their historical milestones., additional_information=...)\n - transfer_task_to_chat_agent_2(task_description=Discuss the technical principles behind an airplane's ability to fly., expected_output=..., additional_information=Simplify complex concepts suitable for someone new to this topic.)\n - transfer_task_to_chat_agent_3(task_description=Evaluate the historical impact of airplanes on society., expected_output=An overview of how airplanes have influenced global connectivity, economies, and the military., additional_information=Provide examples such as the role of airplanes in warfare, tourism, and trade.)\n\nHere's a detailed overview on airplanes' creation, technical principles, and historical impact:\n\n### Creation and Evolution of Airplanes\nAirplanes have a rich history marked by significant milestones and key pioneers:\n- **Early Experimentation (15th-18th centuries):** Leonardo da Vinci's designs laid foundations, but true strides came with glider experiments by Sir George Cayley.\n- **Wright Brothers (1903):** Orville and Wilbur Wright achieved the first successful powered flight with their Wright Flyer.\n- **World Wars Influences:** Both World Wars propelled advancements, like all-metal aircrafts and jet engines.\n- **Modern Aviation:** Wide-body jets and technologies like fly-by-wire systems emerged, improving efficiency and reducing emissions.\n\n### Scientific Principles of Flight\nAirplanes operate based on integrated scientific concepts:\n- **Aerodynamics:** Studies how air interacts with aircraft.\n- **Lift:** The wing shape creates pressure differentials, enabling upward force.\n- **Thrust:** Generated by engines to propel the plane.\n- **Drag:** Resistance that opposes motion through air.\n\n### Historical Impact of Airplanes\nAirplanes have dramatically influenced society in various ways:\n- **Global Connectivity:** Made long-distance travel fast, fostering cultural exchange.\n- **Economic Growth:** Spurred international trade and tourism industries.\n- **Military Influence:** Revolutionized tactics from reconnaissance to strategic bombing.\n\nAirplanes continue to shape the modern world by improving transportation efficiency, facilitating global interactions, and influencing geopolitical strategies.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 316, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 10300, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 303, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 6850, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 279, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 5535}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 4774, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 3051, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2402}, "total_time": [49.49662494659424], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.178847074508667, 8.553655862808228], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [12.797247886657715], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.921919822692871], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [9.658642053604126]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1924, 4027], "completion": [221, 297], "total": [2145, 4324]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [104], "completion": [888], "total": [992]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [85], "completion": [525], "total": [610]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [71], "completion": [359], "total": [430]}}}

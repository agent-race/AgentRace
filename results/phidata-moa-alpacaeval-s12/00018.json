By rubbing these glands against people, they release pheromones, marking the person as part of their territory. This behavior, known as **bunting**, helps cats feel secure in their environment and signals to other animals that you are part of their domain.\n\n#### 2. **Social Bonding**\nThis action is also a social and affiliative behavior. Cats often rub against humans to express affection, trust, and to greet them. It serves as a way of strengthening the bond between cats and their human companions, sometimes observed with other cats within a colony.\n\n#### 3. **Attention-Seeking**\nCats may rub against human legs when they are seeking resources such as food or attention. This behavior is often paired with meowing or purring to get additional focus from their caregivers.\n\n#### 4. **Stress Relief**\nSome studies suggest that rubbing may provide cats with comfort by releasing endorphins. This calming effect can occur in new or stressful environments, where the familiar scent of their human can help a cat feel more secure.\n\n#### 5. **Sensory Stimulation**\nCats may enjoy the tactile sensation of rubbing against human legs as they explore their surroundings. This serves as a way for them to engage with textures and express themselves physically.\n\n---\n\n### Scientific Evidence and Observations\n- **Territorial Marking**: Research in animal behavior notes that territorial scent-marking helps reduce their anxiety in multi-cat or unfamiliar environments.\n- **Affection-Driven Behavior**: Studies suggest rubbing is most frequent toward humans who provide positive reinforcement, such as food or affection.\n- **Stress Management**: The release of pheromones during rubbing likely contributes to a calming effect.\n\n### Conclusion\nCats rub against people for multiple reasons: to mark territory, build a social bond, get attention, or soothe themselves. It\u2019s a behavior deeply rooted in their instincts and emotional needs, making it their natural way of interacting with their environment and owners. Understanding these motivations helps deepen the human-cat relationship!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 242, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 7204, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 289, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 7532, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 303, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 6855}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 3263, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 3399, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 3050}, "total_time": [55.34107518196106], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.9784228801727295, 6.986462116241455], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [9.433202981948853], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [13.90693187713623], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [10.539958953857422]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1923, 3825], "completion": [208, 459], "total": [2131, 4284]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [96], "completion": [510], "total": [606]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [80], "completion": [581], "total": [661]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [71], "completion": [523], "total": [594]}}}

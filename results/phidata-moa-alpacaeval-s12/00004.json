Even edges give a polished look.\n\n3. **Position the Gift**\n   - Center the gift on the wrapping paper, ensuring it aligns evenly with the paper's edges.\n\n4. **Wrap Securely**\n   - Fold one edge of the paper over the top of the gift, then bring the other edge to overlap neatly, securing with tape.\n\n5. **Tidy the Corners**\n   - At each end of the gift, push in the sides to create triangles. Fold down the top triangle, then the bottom triangle so it overlaps neatly. Secure with tape.\n\n6. **Add Final Touches**\n   - Use ribbons, bows, or name tags to decorate.\n   - Optional: Smooth out wrinkles in the wrapping paper using your fingers or a flat tool like a ruler.\n\n---\n\n### **Tips for Professional-Looking Results**\n1. **Choose Quality Materials**\n   - Use thick, high-quality wrapping paper that doesn\u2019t tear easily.\n   - Opt for double-sided tape for an invisible and neat finish.\n\n2. **Crisp Folds and Tidy Edges**\n   - Always smooth out creases as you fold.\n   - Use a ruler or a bone folder to create sharp folds.\n\n3. **Alignment**\n   - Match patterns if using patterned wrapping paper for a seamless look.\n\n4. **Decorate Thoughtfully**\n   - Tie a perfectly centered ribbon or create a bow for visual appeal.\n   - Add personalized touches, like a small ornament or handwritten gift tag.\n\n---\n\n### **Avoid These Common Mistakes**\n#### 1. **Incorrect Paper Size**\n- **Mistake**: Using too little or excessive wrapping paper.\n- **Fix**: Measure the gift and cut accordingly, leaving just enough overlap.\n\n#### 2. **Haphazard Tape**\n- **Mistake**: Overusing tape or poor placement.\n- **Fix**: Use discrete, minimal pieces of clear tape for secure wrapping.\n\n#### 3. **Bulky or Uneven Folds**\n- **Mistake**: Lumpy or misaligned folds.\n- **Fix**: Tuck excess paper under and create clean, straight lines.\n\n#### 4. **Skipping Finishing Touches**\n- **Mistake**: Not adding ribbons, name tags, or embellishments.\n- **Fix**: Enhance presentation by incorporating small details.\n\n---\n\nUsing these techniques and avoiding common errors will make your gift look neat, professional, and thoughtful!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 311, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 6443, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 361, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 7122, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 316, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 6760}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2848, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 3158, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2996}, "total_time": [44.145190954208374], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [4.236166000366211, 10.154155969619751], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.586670875549316], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.96924090385437], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [12.122297048568726]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1919, 4020], "completion": [237, 639], "total": [2156, 4659]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [110], "completion": [525], "total": [635]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [92], "completion": [592], "total": [684]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [73], "completion": [592], "total": [665]}}}

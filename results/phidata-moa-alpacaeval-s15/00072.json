Secure the bag tightly with a rubber band or twist tie.\n\n3. **Let it Soak**: Allow the showerhead to soak in the vinegar for 1-3 hours, or overnight for significant buildup. The vinegar will help dissolve mineral deposits like calcium.\n\n4. **Rinse and Scrub**: After soaking, remove the bag and rinse the showerhead with hot water to flush out loosened mineral deposits. If needed, use an old toothbrush to scrub away remaining grime or residue.\n\n5. **Final Rinse**: Thoroughly rinse the showerhead with warm water to ensure all vinegar is removed before use.\n\n6. **Reattach**: If you detached the showerhead for cleaning, ensure it's dry and reattach it to the water spout. Test it by running water through it.\n\n### Bonus Tip:\nFor a deeper clean, you may also unscrew the showerhead (if detachable) and soak it in a bowl of vinegar.\n\nThis simple method is effective, inexpensive, and requires no harsh chemicals, making it a great solution for maintaining your showerhead's performance and appearance.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 293, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 3975, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 282, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 4491, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 255, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 4069}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 1623, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 1882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 1681}, "total_time": [49.60565495491028], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [12.426626920700073, 10.526125192642212], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.990567922592163], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [2.558345079421997], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [11.646039962768555]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [2360, 3468], "completion": [218, 354], "total": [2578, 3822]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [104], "completion": [224], "total": [328]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [82], "completion": [302], "total": [384]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [73], "completion": [267], "total": [340]}}}

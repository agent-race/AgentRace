Here's a consolidated view:\n\n### First Lead Vocalist of Starship\n\n#### Mickey Thomas\n1. **Role**: Mickey Thomas was the first lead vocalist of Starship.\n2. **Joining**: He joined during the band's earlier incarnation as Jefferson Starship in 1979.\n3. **Transition**: In 1984, the band transitioned to just \"Starship,\" where Mickey continued as the lead vocalist.\n4. **Contributions**: His powerful tenor voice was a defining feature of Starship\u2019s music, leading them to major hits during the 1980s, including *\"We Built This City,\"* *\"Sara,\"* and *\"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now.\"*\n\n#### Confusion in Response\nThere was a mention of **Debi Gibson** as the first lead vocalist in one response, but this seems to be incorrect. The accurate information, based on the majority and corroborated by historical records, points to Mickey Thomas as the first lead vocalist when the band became known as Starship.\n\nTherefore, **Mickey Thomas** should be considered as the first lead vocalist of Starship after its transition from Jefferson Starship.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 377, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 3931, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 288, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 3461, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 341, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 4005}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 1559, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 1364, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 1606}, "total_time": [119.22489404678345], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [9.496627807617188, 18.705939054489136], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [62.41242289543152], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [2.156358003616333], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [17.898231029510498]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [2359, 3312], "completion": [253, 257], "total": [2612, 3569]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [121], "completion": [200], "total": [321]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [85], "completion": [202], "total": [287]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [88], "completion": [268], "total": [356]}}}

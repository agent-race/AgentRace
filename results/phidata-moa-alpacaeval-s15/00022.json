For healthy growth, the soil used should mimic natural desert conditions, ensuring proper drainage, aeration, and minimal water retention. Below are the critical characteristics of an ideal cactus soil:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Attributes for Cactus Soil**\n1. **Well-Draining Soil:**  \n   - Drainage is vital as cacti are prone to root rot if their roots remain in waterlogged conditions.  \n   - The soil should allow water to pass through quickly. Adding coarse sand, pumice, or perlite is recommended to enhance drainage.\n\n2. **Sandy or Rocky Texture:**  \n   - A gritty, loose mixture with sand, gravel, or small rocks prevents soil compaction.  \n   - Heavy, clay-based soils should be avoided as they retain moisture.\n\n3. **Good Aeration:**  \n   - Aerated soil ensures oxygen flow to the roots.  \n   - Components like perlite, pumice, or lava rocks improve airflow and maintain dryness.\n\n4. **Low Organic Matter:**  \n   - Cacti do not need nutrient-rich soil; organic material (e.g., compost) is minimal or absent.  \n   - This prevents excessive water retention which could harm roots.\n\n5. **Slightly Acidic to Neutral pH:**  \n   - Most cacti thrive in soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5.  \n   - Excessively alkaline or acidic soil can affect nutrient uptake.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Soil Mix for Cacti**\n- **40\u201350% coarse sand or grit**  \n- **30\u201340% perlite or pumice**  \n- **10\u201320% low-nutrient potting soil**\n\n---\n\n### **Preparing Cactus Soil at Home**\n1. Mix a commercial cactus-specific potting mix with sand and rocks for added drainage.  \n2. Check soil pH and adjust by adding lime (to raise pH) or sulfur (to lower pH).  \n3. Avoid over-fertilizing, as cacti require minimal nutrients.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nCactus soil must prioritize **drainage, aeration, and low moisture retention**. By maintaining these conditions, you can ensure your cacti stay healthy and thrive in your home or garden.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 442, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 6436, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 355, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 3750, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 357, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 5041}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2779, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 1475, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2116}, "total_time": [69.66777300834656], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.188544034957886, 17.46684503555298], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.8685760498046875], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.3907179832458496], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [25.967560052871704]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [2355, 3786], "completion": [264, 498], "total": [2619, 4284]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [136], "completion": [502], "total": [638]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [90], "completion": [187], "total": [277]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [86], "completion": [384], "total": [470]}}}

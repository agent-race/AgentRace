Choices include aluminum and steel.\n\n### Eco-Friendly Materials\n\n- **Bamboo**: Rapidly renewable and strong, bamboo serves as a sustainable alternative for construction needs.\n\n- **Straw Bales**: Excellent insulators made from a renewable resource, straw bales fit well into eco-conscious construction.\n\n- **Cork**: Harvested sustainably from cork oak trees, it's fire-resistant and provides superb insulation.\n\n### Weather-Resistant and Low-Maintenance Options\n\n- **Fiber Cement Siding**: Resists moisture, rot, and pests with minimal upkeep and is excellent for exterior walls.\n\n- **Composite Decking**: Made from recycled materials, it\u2019s resistant to rot, fade, and splinter, requiring little maintenance.\n\n- **Vinyl Windows**: Waterproof and insulating, these are low-maintenance compared to wooden alternatives, great for humid or cold climates.\n\n### Considerations\n\n- **Cost Concerns**: Options like metal roofing may have a higher initial cost but offer longevity and savings in maintenance.\n\n- **Sustainability Focus**: Choose materials that reduce environmental impact, like recycled wood and straw bales.\n\n- **Durability and Climate Adaptability**: Use materials that withstand extreme weather conditions, like metal and concrete.\n\nBy carefully selecting the materials based on these factors, you can build a cabin that not only meets your design needs but also fits your budget and environmental values.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 322, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 7470, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 311, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 7420, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 317, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 6741}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 3356, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 3332, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2986}, "total_time": [61.29401612281799], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [3.844146966934204, 8.51468014717102], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.490417957305908], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.942335844039917], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [26.678608179092407]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [2355, 4487], "completion": [224, 403], "total": [2579, 4890]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [108], "completion": [549], "total": [657]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [82], "completion": [569], "total": [651]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [73], "completion": [623], "total": [696]}}}

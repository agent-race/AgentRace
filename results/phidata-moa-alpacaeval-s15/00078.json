These may indicate leaks from the roof, pipes, or appliances.\n- **Humidity and Mold:** Check for signs of mold or mildew growth, often triggered by leaking water.\n- **Dripping Sounds & High Water Bills:** Listen for unusual sounds like dripping or running water, and notice any unexpected hikes in your water bills.\n- **Dampness & Bubbling Paint:** Observe damp or wet spots on floors and look for bubbling or raised paint, which can signal a leak behind walls or ceilings.\n\n### Tools and Techniques\n- **Water Meter Test:** Turn off all water sources and monitor your water meter. If it moves, a leak might be present.\n- **Food Coloring Test:** Add coloring to your toilet tank; colors appearing in the toilet bowl without flushing indicate a leak.\n- **Infrared Cameras:** Use infrared cameras to detect temperature changes behind walls, detecting moisture or leaks.\n- **Sound Detection:** Use listening devices to identify the sounds of running water or escaping fluids.\n\n### Advanced Methods\n- **Acoustic Leak Detection:** Specialized devices can amplify sounds of water escaping from pipes.\n- **Dye Testing for Drains:** Adding dye can reveal hidden leaks if colors seep without using the fixtures.\n- **Pressure Testing:** Professional plumbers often perform pressure tests to identify minute leaks throughout your plumbing system.\n- **Consulting with Professionals:** When DIY methods fall short, consulting professionals who use sophisticated techniques can ensure accurate and efficient leak detection.\n\nBy following these methods and being observant, you can spot water leaks early, thereby averting any significant damage to your home.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 290, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 6780, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 288, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 5203, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 292, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 5946}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 3027, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2235, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2601}, "total_time": [44.62826418876648], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [4.727102041244507, 6.427014112472534], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.370521068572998], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.162281036376953], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [12.97895884513855]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [2358, 4046], "completion": [221, 357], "total": [2579, 4403]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [103], "completion": [553], "total": [656]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [88], "completion": [372], "total": [460]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [69], "completion": [430], "total": [499]}}}

It can be played as singles (one player vs. one player) or doubles (two players vs. two). The goal is to score points by hitting the ball in such a way that your opponent cannot return it.\n\n---\n\n### **Equipment Needed**\n- **Racquet**: A short-handled racquet with a wrist strap.\n- **Ball**: A small, hollow rubber ball (available in different speeds for beginners to advanced players).\n- **Protective Gear**: Goggles or protective glasses (highly recommended for safety).\n- **Clothing**: Comfortable, breathable clothes and court shoes for traction.\n\n---\n\n### **Court Setup**\n- Rectangular, enclosed court measuring **20 ft wide, 40 ft long, and 20 ft high**.\n- Features walls on all sides: front wall, back wall, and side walls.\n- Key court lines include:\n  - The **Short Line**, dividing the court into front and back halves.\n  - The **Service Box**, marked between the service line and short line where serves are made.\n\n---\n\n### **Basic Rules and Gameplay**\n1. **Objective**  \n   Hit the ball so that it makes contact with the front wall, and your opponent is unable to hit it back before it bounces twice.\n\n2. **Serving**\n   - The game starts with a serve. The server stands in the service zone, bounces the ball on the floor, and hits it toward the front wall.\n   - The ball must hit the front wall and land beyond the short line before the opponent can return it.\n   - The server continues serving until they lose a rally, after which the opposing player gets to serve.\n\n3. **Rallies**\n   - Players take turns hitting the ball either off the bounce or before it bounces (a volley).\n   - Shots can bounce off the side walls, back walls, or ceiling, but the ball **must hit the front wall before it touches the floor again**.\n   - Avoid letting the ball bounce twice before returning, as this results in a point for the opponent.\n\n4. **Scoring**\n   - Points can only be scored by the serving player.\n   - A standard game is played to **15 points**, and players must win by at least **2 points**.\n   - Matches are typically **best two out of three games**, with the third game (if needed) being played to 11 points.\n\n5. **Faults and Hinders**\n   - **Fault Serve**: A serve is invalid if:\n     - The ball doesn\u2019t cross the short line.\n     - The ball bounces outside the court boundaries or in the safety zone.\n   - **Hinder**: If a player unintentionally blocks their opponent's ability to play, the rally is replayed.\n\n---\n\n### **Winning the Game**\nTo win, simply score by returning the ball strategically and outlasting your opponent during rallies until they make errors. Matches are typically **best of three games**, and the winner is the first player/team to claim at least two games.\n\n---\n\n### **Tips for Beginners**\n- **Practice Serving**: Start with consistent, legal serves to gain an advantage.\n- **Movement**: Anticipate the ball\u2019s path and position yourself quickly.\n- **Simple Shots**: Focus on mastering basic forehand and backhand returns before using tricky shots.\n- **Play Smart**: Use the walls to your advantage by planning angles that make the ball harder to return.\n- **Stay Safe**: Always wear protective eyewear as the ball can travel quickly.\n\n---\n\nBy following these guidelines and practicing, you\u2019ll soon find racquetball to be an exciting and rewarding sport!

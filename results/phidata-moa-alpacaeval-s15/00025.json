Their extinction is linked to climate change and human hunting.\n\n2. **Giant Short-Faced Bear (Arctodus simus)**:\n   - **Time Period**: Pleistocene (11,000 years ago).\n   - **Significance**: Known as one of the largest terrestrial carnivorous mammals that roamed North America. Its extinction coincides with the disappearance of other megafauna.\n\n3. **Atlas Bear (Ursus arctos crowtheri)**:\n   - **Time Period**: Extinct in the late 19th century (around the 1870s).\n   - **Significance**: The only bear native to Africa, found in the Atlas Mountains. Its extinction was due to hunting and habitat loss.\n\n4. **Florida Cave Bear (Tremarctos floridanus)**:\n   - **Time Period**: Pleistocene (11,000 years ago).\n   - **Significance**: Related to the modern spectacled bear, it lived in the southeastern United States.\n\n5. **Deninger\u2019s Bear (Ursus deningeri)**:\n   - **Time Period**: Middle Pleistocene (500,000 to 100,000 years ago).\n   - **Significance**: This species is considered transitional between Ursus etruscus and the cave bear, providing insights into bear evolution.\n\n6. **Bulldog Bear (Ursus crassarius)**:\n   - **Significance**: An extinct bear species known for its distinctive bulldog-like skull shape.\n\n7. **Pliocyon**:\n   - **Significance**: While not a bear, Pliocyon is considered an early bear ancestor due to shared characteristics.\n\nThese species provide insights into the evolutionary history and adaptations of bears over time. Most extinctions can be attributed to natural climatic shifts, human interactions, and habitat changes.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 203, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 5715, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 192, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 8327, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 231, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 6465}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2538, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 3845, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2891}, "total_time": [72.03805184364319], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [4.558884143829346, 28.333805799484253], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [6.841024160385132], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [9.341222047805786], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [15.349223136901855]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [2357, 4425], "completion": [173, 471], "total": [2530, 4896]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [88], "completion": [469], "total": [557]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [63], "completion": [782], "total": [845]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [60], "completion": [540], "total": [600]}}}

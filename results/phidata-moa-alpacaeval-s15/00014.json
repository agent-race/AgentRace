This tradition has evolved due to a combination of historical events, cultural influences, and practical culinary considerations.\n\n### Historical Context: The First Thanksgiving\nThe first Thanksgiving, often referenced in 1621, was a harvest feast between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag Native Americans in Plymouth, Massachusetts. Although the exact menu is uncertain, wild fowl, which could have included turkey, was likely part of the meal. This set a historical precedent for turkey's association with Thanksgiving.\n\n### Cultural Traditions and Advocacy\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, the practicality and size of turkey made it a favorable choice for feeding large gatherings. Sarah Josepha Hale, a key figure in making Thanksgiving a national holiday, promoted the idea of a turkey centerpiece in her writings. Her influential role helped standardize Thanksgiving meals around turkey.\n\n### Culinary and Practical Factors\nTurkeys are large enough to serve multiple people and were naturally abundant in the U.S., offering an easy and suitable option for a feast. Unlike other livestock, turkeys were primarily raised for meat. This practical suitability made them an appealing choice for Thanksgiving meals.\n\n### Conclusion\nTurkey became the centerpiece of Thanksgiving due to its accessibility, practicality for feeding large groups, and cultural promotion over time. These factors intertwined to make turkey the iconic dish of the holiday, symbolizing abundance and gratitude.\n\nThe above synthesis provides a comprehensive view of the cultural and historical dynamics that established turkey as the quintessential Thanksgiving dish.

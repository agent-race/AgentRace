Here are some key reasons why they do this:\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Scent Marking**\nCats have scent glands located on their cheeks, face, and tail. When rubbing against your legs, they use these glands to:\n- **Mark Territory**: This establishes you as part of their territory, giving them a sense of ownership and comfort.\n- **Communicate**: The pheromones they leave behind can signal familiarity and help maintain social bonds within their environment.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Showing Affection**\nThis is perceived as an act of trust and warmth. Cats express their affection or bond through rubbing, often accompanied by purring or tail flicking. It's their way of saying, \"I like you, and you belong to my circle.\"\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Seeking Attention**\nCats might rub to get your attention, whether for petting, playtime, food, or simply interaction. They are excellent communicators who use physical touch to initiate contact.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Stress Relief & Self-Soothing**\nRubbing, especially in familiar surroundings, may be a calming behavior for cats. By connecting with a trusted person, they may counter anxiety and feel secure.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Social Bonding**\nIn colonies or multi-cat households, this behavior helps build and strengthen relationships. By rubbing against you, they see you as part of their extended feline family.\n\n---\n\n### Feline Insights\nThis behavior connects to their instincts and social needs. Cats mark their surroundings (even humans!) with their scent to ensure familiarity and claim it as \"safe space.\" Additionally, rubbing builds on their communal bonding practices and communication habits.\n\nWould you like suggestions for better understanding your cat\u2019s body language as part of this behavior?", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 259, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 6409, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 212, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 5865, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 254, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 5536}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2857, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2604, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2415}, "total_time": [62.27250385284424], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.058943033218384, 13.22771406173706], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [14.316388130187988], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [7.8217689990997314], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [10.836397886276245]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [2358, 3892], "completion": [191, 377], "total": [2549, 4269]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [100], "completion": [455], "total": [555]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [68], "completion": [408], "total": [476]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [63], "completion": [394], "total": [457]}}}

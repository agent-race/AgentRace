Avoid aquariums and plastic cages unless they allow proper ventilation.  \n\n2. **Bedding**:  \n   - Opt for paper-based bedding (dust-free and absorbent) or fleece. Wood shavings can be used but may cause respiratory issues.  \n\n3. **Accessories and Enrichment**:  \n   - Include hiding spots like tunnels and houses, climbing structures (ladders, ropes), and toys for mental and physical stimulation.  \n   - Provide a sturdy food bowl and a water bowl or bottle.  \n\n4. **Safety Considerations**:  \n   - Maintain a temperature of 65-75\u00b0F, relative humidity of 50-60%, and a quiet space to minimize stress.  \n\n---\n\n### **Feeding Guidelines**\n1. **Staple Foods**:  \n   - High-quality commercial rat pellets as the primary food source (about 1 tablespoon daily per rat).  \n\n2. **Fresh Veggies and Fruits**:  \n   - Vegetables: Carrots, broccoli, spinach, green beans (approx. 1-2 tablespoons).  \n   - Fruits: Apples, bananas, berries (small pieces, limit sugary fruits).  \n\n3. **Treats**:  \n   - Offer grains, seeds, or protein sources like cooked chicken or boiled egg occasionally.  \n\n4. **Foods to Avoid**:  \n   - Onions, garlic, dairy products, high-fat and sugary foods, salted snacks.  \n\n5. **Fresh Water**:  \n   - Always provide clean, fresh water.  \n\n---\n\n### **General Care Tips**\n1. **Social Interaction**:  \n   - Rats are social creatures; consider keeping them in pairs or groups (same sex for non-breeding).  \n   - Spend 1-2 hours daily interacting with your rat to build trust.  \n\n2. **Exercise and Enrichment**:  \n   - Allow daily free-roaming in a rat-proof area.  \n   - Rotate toys and change cage layouts weekly for mental stimulation.  \n\n3. **Health Monitoring**:  \n   - Conduct regular health checks for signs of illness (e.g., labored breathing, dull fur).  \n   - Schedule annual vet visits for preventative care.  \n\n4. **Comfort and Routine**:  \n   - Provide hiding spots (hammocks, boxes) to reduce stress.  \n   - Maintain consistent feeding and play schedules.  \n\n---\n\nBy following this guide, you can ensure your pet rat lives a happy, healthy, and enriching life.

These particles are carried towards Earth by the solar wind. The Earth's magnetic field guides these particles toward the magnetic poles, where they interact with gases in the atmosphere, primarily oxygen and nitrogen. This interaction excites the atoms and molecules, causing them to emit light in varying colors. The display can range from soft greens, which are most common, to reds, blues, and purples depending on the type of gases and altitude of interaction.\n\n### Layman's Explanation\nImagine the sun as a giant bell sending out a wind full of particles. When this solar wind reaches Earth, it gets caught in the Earth\u2019s magnetic field and pulled towards the poles. There, it meets different gases in the atmosphere. When they all bump into each other, it causes colorful lights to fill the sky \u2013 that's what we see as the northern lights!\n\n### Conditions for Visibility\n1. **Geographical Location**: Best viewed near the magnetic poles, such as northern Scandinavia, Iceland, Canada, Alaska, and Greenland.\n2. **Time of Year**: Most visible during the winter months (September to March), especially around the equinoxes.\n3. **Weather**: Clear, dark skies are essential, as clouds and light pollution hinder visibility.\n4. **Solar Activity**: Strong solar winds and geomagnetic storms, indicated by a Kp index of 4 or higher, can enhance the lights.\n5. **Time of Night**: The best time to view is typically between 10 PM and 2 AM. \n\nThe northern lights are a stunning natural spectacle resulting from cosmic interactions between solar particles and Earth's magnetic atmosphere.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 403, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 6533, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 323, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 4046, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 399, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 5773}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2847, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 1639, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2461}, "total_time": [58.46189999580383], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [16.595847845077515, 6.355283975601196], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [6.784817934036255], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.2829740047454834], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [14.578404903411865]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [2352, 3779], "completion": [258, 376], "total": [2610, 4155]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [123], "completion": [436], "total": [559]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [88], "completion": [222], "total": [310]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [91], "completion": [424], "total": [515]}}}

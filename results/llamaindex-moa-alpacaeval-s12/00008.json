Here are some common categories you might consider for your drawers:\n\n1. **Underwear and Socks Drawer**: This drawer can hold all your undergarments, including bras, panties, boxers, briefs, and socks. You might add dividers to keep them neatly separated.\n\n2. **T-Shirt Drawer**: Dedicate a drawer to casual tops like t-shirts and tank tops. Rolling them can maximize space and make it easier to see what you have.\n\n3. **Pajamas and Loungewear Drawer**: Keep all your sleepwear and comfortable at-home clothes in one place for easy access.\n\n4. **Workout Clothes Drawer**: Store athletic wear like leggings, sports bras, gym shorts, and workout tops together so you can quickly grab what you need for a workout.\n\n5. **Sweaters and Sweatshirts Drawer**: These bulkier items can take up more space, so it\u2019s helpful to have a dedicated drawer for them.\n\n6. **Jeans and Pants Drawer**: Fold or roll your jeans, trousers, and casual pants and store them in a drawer to keep them organized.\n\n7. **Shorts Drawer**: Keep all types of shorts, such as denim, casual, and athletic, in one spot.\n\n8. **Seasonal or Specialty Drawer**: This could be a place for items that are not used year-round, like swimwear, scarves, or hats.\n\n9. **Accessories Drawer**: Smaller drawers can be used for accessories like belts, ties, handkerchiefs, or jewelry.\n\n10. **Miscellaneous Drawer**: For items that don't fit neatly into other categories, or for overflow, a miscellaneous drawer can be useful.\n\nTailor the organization to fit your lifestyle and wardrobe needs.

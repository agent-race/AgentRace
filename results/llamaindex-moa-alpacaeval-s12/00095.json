Tong Sui (literally \"sugar water\") is a category of sweet soups or dessert soups that are popular in Hong Kong and southern China. They are comforting, lightly sweet, and perfect for serving to guests as a delightful end to a meal. One of the classic Tong Sui recipes is **Red Bean Soup (Hong Dou Tang)**. Here's how you can make it:\n\n### **Red Bean Soup Recipe**\nServes: 4-6  \nPrep Time: 10 minutes  \nCook Time: 1-1.5 hours  \n\n---\n\n#### **Ingredients**:\n- 1 cup dried red beans (adzuki beans)\n- 8 cups water\n- 1/4 cup dried tangerine peel (optional, adds a citrusy aroma)\n- 1/3 cup rock sugar (or granulated sugar, adjust to taste)\n- 1/4 cup small tapioca pearls (optional, for added texture)\n- A pinch of salt (to enhance flavor)\n\n---\n\n#### **Instructions**:\n\n1. **Prep the Red Beans**:\n   - Rinse the dried red beans thoroughly under cold water.\n   - Optional: Soak the beans in water for 4-6 hours or overnight to reduce cooking time. Drain before cooking.\n\n2. **Cook the Beans**:\n   - In a large pot, add the red beans and 8 cups of water. Bring to a boil over high heat.\n   - Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer uncovered for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the beans are soft and breaking apart. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.\n\n3. **Prepare the Tangerine Peel**:\n   - If using dried tangerine peel, rinse it and soak it in warm water for about 10 minutes to soften. Scrape off the white pith to avoid bitterness, then add the peel to the pot during the last 20 minutes of simmering.\n\n4. **Add Sweetness**:\n   - Stir in the rock sugar (or granulated sugar) and cook until it dissolves completely. Taste and adjust the sweetness to your preference.\n\n5. **Optional Tapioca Pearls**:\n   - If using tapioca pearls, cook them separately according to the package instructions (usually by boiling for about 10 minutes, then rinsing in cold water). Add the cooked tapioca pearls to the red bean soup just before serving.\n\n6. **Finish and Serve**:\n   - Add a pinch of salt to enhance the flavors, then give the soup a final stir.\n   - Serve the Tong Sui warm or chilled, depending on your preference.\n\n---\n\n### **Tips**:\n- For a creamier texture, you can blend a portion of the soup with an immersion blender or mash some of the red beans with a spoon.\n- Other variations include adding coconut milk, glutinous rice balls, or lotus seeds for additional flavor and texture.\n\nThis comforting dessert soup is sure to impress your guests with its balance of sweetness and hearty texture.

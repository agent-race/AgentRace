Proper detailing requires time, patience, and the right tools and products. Here's a step-by-step guide to detailing a car:\n\n---\n\n### **Exterior Detailing**\n\n1. **Gather Supplies**:\n   - Car wash soap (not dish soap)\n   - Two buckets (one for soapy water, one for rinse water)\n   - Microfiber wash mitts or sponges\n   - Microfiber towels\n   - Wheel cleaner and tire brush\n   - Bug/tar remover (if needed)\n   - Clay bar or clay mitt\n   - Car polish or compound (optional)\n   - Car wax, sealant, or ceramic coating\n   - Foam cannon (optional, for pressure washer users)\n\n2. **Wash the Wheels and Tires**:\n   - Start with the dirtiest part of the car: the wheels and tires.\n   - Use a wheel cleaner and a soft brush to scrub the rims and tires.\n   - Rinse thoroughly, ensuring brake dust and grime are removed.\n\n3. **Pre-Rinse the Vehicle**:\n   - Use a hose or pressure washer to rinse off loose dirt and debris from the car's surface. Start from the roof and work your way down.\n\n4. **Two-Bucket Wash Method**:\n   - Fill one bucket with soapy water and the other with clean rinse water.\n   - Use a microfiber mitt to gently wash the car, dunking it in the rinse bucket before reloading with soap. This prevents scratching.\n   - Wash section by section, starting from the top and working downward.\n\n5. **Rinse and Dry**:\n   - Rinse the car thoroughly.\n   - Use a microfiber drying towel or a car dryer (air blower) to dry the car without streaks or water spots.\n\n6. **Clay Bar Treatment** (Optional but Recommended):\n   - Use a clay bar or clay mitt with a lubricant to remove embedded contaminants like tar, sap, or industrial fallout.\n   - Work in small sections, rubbing gently until the surface feels smooth.\n\n7. **Polish the Paint** (Optional):\n   - Use a car polish or compound to remove light scratches, swirl marks, and oxidation.\n   - Apply using a dual-action (DA) polisher or by hand with a foam applicator.\n\n8. **Apply Wax, Sealant, or Ceramic Coating**:\n   - Protect the paint by applying a layer of wax or sealant. Use a foam applicator and buff with a clean microfiber towel.\n   - For long-term protection, consider a ceramic coating, but follow product-specific instructions.\n\n9. **Clean the Glass**:\n   - Use an automotive glass cleaner and a microfiber towel to clean windows inside and out.\n   - Avoid ammonia-based cleaners, as they can damage tint.\n\n10. **Detail the Trim and Tires**:\n    - Apply a trim restorer to faded plastic or rubber.\n    - Use a tire dressing to give the tires a clean, shiny look.\n\n---\n\n### **Interior Detailing**\n\n1. **Remove Trash and Debris**:\n   - Take out all floor mats, personal items, and trash from the car.\n\n2. **Vacuum Thoroughly**:\n   - Use a vacuum cleaner with attachments to clean carpets, seats, and crevices.\n   - Pay attention to areas around the pedals, under the seats, and in between crevices.\n\n3. **Clean the Upholstery**:\n   - For fabric seats, use a fabric cleaner and a soft brush to remove stains.\n   - For leather seats, use a leather cleaner and conditioner to clean and protect the surface.\n\n4. **Clean the Carpets and Mats**:\n   - Use a carpet cleaner or a steam cleaner to deep-clean carpets.\n   - Clean rubber mats with soap, water, and a stiff brush.\n\n5. **Wipe Down Surfaces**:\n   - Use an interior cleaner to wipe down the dashboard, center console, door panels, and other hard surfaces.\n   - Use a soft-bristle brush to clean vents and hard-to-reach areas.\n\n6. **Protect Interior Surfaces**:\n   - Apply a UV-protectant dressing to plastic, vinyl, or rubber surfaces to prevent fading and cracking.\n\n7. **Clean the Glass**:\n   - Use an automotive glass cleaner to clean the inside of the windows and mirrors. Wipe with a microfiber towel for a streak-free finish.\n\n8. **Deodorize**:\n   - Use an odor eliminator or air freshener to keep the car smelling fresh.\n   - Consider replacing the cabin air filter if the odor persists.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Checks**\n- Walk around the car and inspect your work for missed spots.\n- Use an extra microfiber towel to remove any smudges or streaks.\n\n**Pro Tips**:\n- Work in a shaded area to avoid water spots and streaks caused by the sun.\n- Use high-quality products and tools to avoid damaging your car's surfaces.\n- Regular maintenance detailing will keep your car looking new and extend its lifespan.\n\nBy following these steps, you\u2019ll achieve a professional-level detail and keep your car in great condition!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1036, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1027, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1020, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1036, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 3468, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1027, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 3744, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1020, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 3567, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 1036, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 3606, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 1027, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 3427, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 1020, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 3033, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 1036, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 3250, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 1027, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2796, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 1020, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 3264, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 2934, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 3131, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 2650}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 90, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 64, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 61, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 898, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 82, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 889, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 64, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 882, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 70, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 898, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 78, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 889, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 73, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 882, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 61, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 47, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 72, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 66}, "total_time": [74.43492984771729], "llm_time": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [6.169645071029663, 6.317637920379639, 5.383723020553589, 5.441980838775635], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [7.427673101425171, 7.693156003952026, 5.482848882675171, 5.7284839153289795], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [21.37550687789917, 14.85829782485962, 22.00083613395691, 19.632478952407837], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [32.48560810089111]}, "llm_tokens": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [36, 36, 36, 36], "completion": [794, 809, 724, 665], "total": [830, 845, 760, 701]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [42, 42, 42, 42], "completion": [817, 829, 749, 731], "total": [859, 871, 791, 773]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [10, 10, 10, 10], "completion": [841, 704, 799, 647], "total": [851, 714, 809, 657]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [14], "completion": [1062], "total": [1076]}}}

Canjeero is a traditional Somali pancake that is often served for breakfast or as a side dish. It has a unique, slightly sour taste and a spongy texture. Here\u2019s a recipe to make Canjeero:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 2 cups all-purpose flour\n- 1 cup fine semolina flour\n- 1 teaspoon active dry yeast\n- 1 teaspoon sugar\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n- 3 cups lukewarm water (adjust as needed)\n- Oil or butter for cooking\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Batter:**\n   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, yeast, sugar, and salt.\n   - Gradually add the lukewarm water to the dry ingredients while whisking continuously to avoid lumps. The batter should be smooth and slightly runny, similar to pancake batter. You can adjust the water amount to achieve the right consistency.\n\n2. **Ferment the Batter:**\n   - Cover the bowl with a clean cloth or plastic wrap and let it sit in a warm place for about 2 to 3 hours. This allows the batter to ferment and develop its characteristic sour taste.\n\n3. **Cook the Canjeero:**\n   - Once the batter has fermented, gently stir it.\n   - Heat a non-stick skillet or a large flat pan over medium heat. Lightly grease the pan with oil or butter.\n   - Pour a ladleful of batter onto the pan and spread it out in a circular motion using the back of the ladle, similar to making crepes. The batter should be thin and even.\n   - Cook for about 2 to 3 minutes or until the surface is bubbly and the edges start to lift. Canjeero is typically cooked on one side only, so there\u2019s no need to flip it.\n   - Remove the Canjeero from the pan and place it on a plate. Repeat the process with the remaining batter, greasing the pan as needed.\n\n4. **Serve:**\n   - Canjeero is traditionally served warm. It pairs well with a variety of toppings such as honey, butter, or a mixture of sugar and ghee. It can also be served with savory dishes like stews or soups.\n\nEnjoy your homemade Canjeero!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1238, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1229, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1222, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1238, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2227, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1229, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2301, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1222, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2548, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 1238, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2138, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 1229, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 2040, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 1222, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 2487, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 1238, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2466, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 1229, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 2034, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 1222, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 2367, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2487, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 2586, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 2307}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 38, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 41, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 48, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 898, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 43, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 889, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 44, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 882, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 43, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 898, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 51, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 889, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 37, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 882, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 43, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 53, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 46, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 44}, "total_time": [68.92901515960693], "llm_time": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.263459920883179, 4.26001501083374, 3.844036102294922, 4.399449825286865], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [6.81013298034668, 6.862094163894653, 7.054337024688721, 4.374433994293213], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [15.869671821594238, 17.935128927230835, 19.3745219707489, 17.642126083374023], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [32.9613299369812]}, "llm_tokens": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [79, 79, 79, 79], "completion": [538, 548, 493, 571], "total": [617, 627, 572, 650]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [85, 85, 85, 85], "completion": [565, 615, 600, 497], "total": [650, 700, 685, 582]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [53, 53, 53, 53], "completion": [633, 639, 641, 586], "total": [686, 692, 694, 639]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [57], "completion": [472], "total": [529]}}}

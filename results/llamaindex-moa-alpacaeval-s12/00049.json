Here are some practical tips to keep your wooden table in great condition:\n\n### **Daily Maintenance**\n1. **Dust Regularly**:\n   - Use a soft, lint-free cloth or microfiber cloth to remove dust and debris. Dusting prevents buildup that can scratch the surface over time.\n\n2. **Wipe Spills Immediately**:\n   - Use a damp cloth to clean up spills as soon as they happen to prevent stains or water damage. Dry the area thoroughly afterward.\n\n3. **Use Coasters and Placemats**:\n   - Protect the surface from heat, moisture, and scratches by placing coasters under drinks and placemats under plates or bowls.\n\n4. **Avoid Direct Contact with Sharp Objects**:\n   - Be cautious with knives or other sharp objects that can scratch or gouge the wood.\n\n---\n\n### **Periodic Cleaning**\n1. **Clean with Mild Soap**:\n   - Mix a few drops of mild dish soap with warm water. Use a damp cloth to gently clean the surface, then wipe it dry with a soft cloth. Avoid soaking the wood.\n\n2. **Use Appropriate Cleaners**:\n   - For deeper cleaning, use a wood-specific cleaner or polish. Avoid harsh chemicals, ammonia, or abrasive cleaners that can damage the finish.\n\n---\n\n### **Protecting the Finish**\n1. **Apply Wax or Polish**:\n   - Every few months, apply a thin layer of furniture wax or polish to protect the surface and enhance its shine. Use a product suitable for your table's finish (e.g., varnish, lacquer, or oil).\n\n2. **Refinish if Necessary**:\n   - If the table starts to look dull or worn, consider refinishing the surface with wood oil or reapplying a protective coating. Always follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for your table's specific finish.\n\n---\n\n### **Preventing Damage**\n1. **Avoid Direct Sunlight**:\n   - Place your table away from windows or use curtains/blinds to prevent UV rays from fading or discoloring the wood.\n\n2. **Maintain Stable Humidity**:\n   - Wood is sensitive to changes in humidity. Use a humidifier or dehumidifier to keep the room\u2019s humidity levels stable and prevent warping or cracking.\n\n3. **Protect from Heat**:\n   - Avoid placing hot pots, pans, or dishes directly on the table. Use trivets or heat-resistant pads.\n\n4. **Lift Items Instead of Dragging**:\n   - When moving items on the table, lift them instead of dragging to prevent scratches.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Care**\n1. **Inspect for Damage**:\n   - Periodically check for signs of wear, scratches, or cracks. Address small issues before they worsen.\n\n2. **Re-oil or Re-seal**:\n   - If your table has an oil-based finish, reapply wood oil annually to maintain its protection and luster. For sealed tables, reapply a protective coat as needed.\n\n3. **Avoid Heavy Weight or Impact**:\n   - Don\u2019t place excessively heavy objects on the table or allow impacts that could dent or damage the wood.\n\n---\n\n### **Special Considerations**\n- **Antique Tables**: If your table is antique, consult a professional before applying any cleaning products or refinishing techniques.\n- **Different Finishes**: Understand whether your table is painted, stained, or natural wood to choose the right care products.\n\nBy following these tips, your wooden table can remain a beautiful and functional centerpiece in your home for years to come!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1051, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1042, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1035, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1051, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2355, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1042, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2539, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1035, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 1929, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 1051, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2671, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 1042, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 2062, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 1035, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 2588, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 1051, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 1987, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 1042, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2123, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 1035, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 2657, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 1870, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 2296, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 2092}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 37, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 28, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 27, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 898, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 28, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 889, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 27, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 882, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 28, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 898, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 46, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 889, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 41, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 882, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 28, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 33, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 38, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 36}, "total_time": [49.96739196777344], "llm_time": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.21019721031189, 3.3734638690948486, 4.157814025878906, 4.328808069229126], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.947804927825928, 7.710812091827393, 7.2450950145721436, 7.446018218994141], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [14.941783905029297, 21.329267978668213, 11.33144998550415, 14.605374813079834], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [13.993201971054077]}, "llm_tokens": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [39, 39, 39, 39], "completion": [510, 402, 436, 501], "total": [549, 441, 475, 540]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [45, 45, 45, 45], "completion": [540, 553, 561, 548], "total": [585, 598, 606, 593]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [13, 13, 13, 13], "completion": [468, 513, 431, 469], "total": [481, 526, 444, 482]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [17], "completion": [729], "total": [746]}}}

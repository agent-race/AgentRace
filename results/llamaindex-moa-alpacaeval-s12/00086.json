Milanesa de peceto is a classic Argentinian dish that\u2019s loved for its crispy coating and tender meat. It's similar to a breaded cutlet and makes for a delicious meal when paired with a fresh salad or mashed potatoes. Here's a recipe for you to try:\n\n---\n\n### **Milanesa de Peceto (Argentinian Breaded Veal Cutlets)**\n\n#### **Ingredients:**\n- 2 lbs (1 kg) peceto (eye of round beef or veal), sliced into thin cutlets (about 1/4 inch thick)\n- 3 large eggs\n- 1/4 cup milk\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped\n- 1/2 tsp dried oregano (optional)\n- Salt and black pepper, to taste\n- 2 cups breadcrumbs\n- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional, for extra flavor)\n- Vegetable oil for frying (e.g., sunflower or canola oil)\n- Lemon wedges, for serving\n\n---\n\n#### **Instructions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Meat:**\n   - If the peceto slices are too thick, place them between two sheets of plastic wrap and gently pound them with a meat mallet until they are about 1/4 inch thick. Season both sides with salt and pepper.\n\n2. **Make the Egg Mixture:**\n   - In a shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, minced garlic, parsley, oregano (if using), and a pinch of salt and pepper.\n\n3. **Prepare the Breading:**\n   - In another shallow bowl or plate, mix the breadcrumbs with the grated Parmesan cheese (if using).\n\n4. **Bread the Cutlets:**\n   - Dip each slice of meat into the egg mixture, ensuring it\u2019s fully coated. Let any excess egg drip off.\n   - Dredge the meat in the breadcrumb mixture, pressing down gently to ensure the breadcrumbs adhere well. Shake off any excess crumbs.\n\n5. **Fry the Cutlets:**\n   - Heat about 1/4 inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. The oil should be hot but not smoking.\n   - Fry the breaded cutlets in batches, avoiding overcrowding the pan. Cook for about 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy.\n   - Transfer the cooked milanesas to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.\n\n6. **Serve:**\n   - Serve the milanesa hot, accompanied by lemon wedges for squeezing over the cutlets. Popular sides include mashed potatoes, a fresh tomato salad, or French fries.\n\n---\n\n#### **Tips & Variations:**\n- For a lighter version, you can bake the milanesas in the oven at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) on a greased baking sheet for about 20 minutes, flipping halfway through.\n- You can also make \"Milanesa a la Napolitana\" by topping the fried cutlets with tomato sauce, ham, and melted mozzarella cheese, then broiling them for a few minutes.\n- If you can't find peceto, you can use thinly sliced chicken breast, pork, or beef sirloin instead.\n\n---\n\nEnjoy hosting your guests with this Argentinian favorite! It's sure to be a hit at your gatherings. \ud83d\ude0a", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1252, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1243, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1236, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1252, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 1818, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1243, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2015, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1236, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2308, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 1252, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 1862, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 1243, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2136, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 1236, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 2391, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 1252, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2819, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 1243, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 1968, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 1236, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 2471, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2598, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 2486, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 2613}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 36, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 36, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 55, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 898, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 35, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 889, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 46, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 882, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 63, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 898, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 55, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 889, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 36, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 882, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 57, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 51, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 53, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 51}, "total_time": [52.36711597442627], "llm_time": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.686194896697998, 7.951849937438965, 4.5674920082092285, 4.347385883331299], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.194209814071655, 5.872720956802368, 5.4121057987213135, 5.278028964996338], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [19.99993395805359, 19.299076795578003, 21.025772094726562, 21.028080940246582], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [10.163494110107422]}, "llm_tokens": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [83, 83, 83, 83], "completion": [421, 514, 614, 583], "total": [504, 597, 697, 666]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [89, 89, 89, 89], "completion": [487, 563, 449, 502], "total": [576, 652, 538, 591]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [56, 56, 56, 56], "completion": [710, 659, 641, 661], "total": [766, 715, 697, 717]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [60], "completion": [681], "total": [741]}}}

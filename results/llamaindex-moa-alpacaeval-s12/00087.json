Here's a step-by-step guide to help you refill your grandfather's antique fountain pen:\n\n1. **Check the Filling Mechanism**: Antique fountain pens may have different filling mechanisms, such as piston, lever, or cartridge/converter. Identify which one your pen uses.\n\n2. **Prepare the Pen and Ink**: \n   - Ensure your ink bottle is on a stable surface to avoid spills.\n   - Have a paper towel or cloth handy for any excess ink.\n\n3. **For a Lever or Piston Filler**:\n   - **Lever Filler**: \n     - Locate the small lever on the pen\u2019s barrel.\n     - Dip the nib completely into the ink bottle.\n     - Lift the lever to compress the internal sac, and then lower it to create a vacuum that draws ink into the pen.\n     - Repeat if necessary to ensure a full fill.\n     - Wipe off excess ink from the nib with the paper towel.\n\n   - **Piston Filler**: \n     - Unscrew the piston knob at the end of the pen barrel.\n     - Submerge the nib completely in the ink.\n     - Twist the piston knob back into place to draw ink into the pen.\n     - Repeat if necessary for a full fill.\n     - Clean any excess ink from the nib.\n\n4. **For a Cartridge/Converter Filler**:\n   - **Converter**: \n     - If your pen has a converter, it functions similarly to a piston filler.\n     - Attach the converter to the pen if it\u2019s not already.\n     - Submerge the nib in the ink.\n     - Twist or press the converter to fill it with ink.\n     - Clean any excess ink from the nib.\n   \n   - **Cartridge**: \n     - If using a cartridge, simply insert a new ink cartridge into the pen. Press firmly until you feel it puncture and release the ink.\n\n5. **Check the Nib**: \n   - After filling, gently wipe the nib and feed to remove any excess ink.\n   - Test the pen on a piece of paper to ensure it writes smoothly.\n\n6. **Maintenance Tips**:\n   - Regularly clean your pen to prevent ink buildup, especially if changing ink colors.\n   - Store the pen with the nib facing upwards when not in use to prevent leaks.\n\nIf your pen has a unique or unfamiliar filling mechanism, you may want to consult a specialist or look for specific instructions related to the model.

They're flaky, cheesy, and easy to make using store-bought puff pastry or phyllo dough. Here's a recipe you can try:\n\n### **Israeli Cheese Bourekas Recipe**\n\n#### **Ingredients**\n- 1 package puff pastry (thawed if frozen)\n- 1 cup (250g) crumbled feta cheese\n- 1 cup (250g) ricotta cheese (or any creamy soft cheese)\n- 1 egg (lightly beaten, for the filling)\n- 1 egg (for egg wash)\n- 1 tablespoon sour cream (optional, for creaminess)\n- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n- 1/4 teaspoon salt (optional, depending on the saltiness of the feta)\n- Sesame seeds (for garnish)\n\n#### **Instructions**\n\n1. **Preheat the Oven:**\n   Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n\n2. **Prepare the Filling:**\n   In a mixing bowl, combine the feta cheese, ricotta cheese, 1 beaten egg, sour cream (if using), black pepper, and salt (if needed). Mix until everything is well incorporated and smooth.\n\n3. **Roll Out the Dough:**\n   Lightly flour your work surface and roll out the puff pastry to smooth it out. Cut the dough into squares, approximately 3x3 inches (or larger, depending on your preference).\n\n4. **Fill and Fold:**\n   Place a small spoonful of the cheese mixture in the center of each square. Be careful not to overfill, as it can leak out during baking. Fold the squares into triangles (or rectangles if you prefer), pressing the edges firmly to seal. You can use a fork to crimp the edges for extra security and a decorative touch.\n\n5. **Egg Wash:**\n   Beat the remaining egg and brush it over the tops of the bourekas. This will give them a beautiful golden color when baked.\n\n6. **Add Sesame Seeds:**\n   Sprinkle sesame seeds on top of the bourekas for added flavor and texture.\n\n7. **Bake:**\n   Place the filled bourekas on the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between them. Bake in the preheated oven for 20\u201325 minutes, or until golden brown and puffed.\n\n8. **Serve:**\n   Let the bourekas cool for a few minutes before serving. They can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature.\n\n#### **Tips for Serving:**\n- Pair the bourekas with a side of Israeli salad (diced cucumbers, tomatoes, parsley, and lemon dressing) or a dollop of tahini sauce.\n- Serve with a hot cup of tea or coffee for a delightful snack.\n\nYour guests are sure to love these flaky, cheesy treats!

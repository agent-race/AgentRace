Here's a classic recipe for making delicious homemade challah:\n\n---\n\n### **Classic Challah Recipe**\n\n#### **Ingredients**\n- **For the Dough:**\n  - 4 cups (500g) all-purpose flour (plus extra for dusting)\n  - 1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar\n  - 2 1/4 tsp (1 packet) active dry yeast\n  - 1 tsp salt\n  - 3/4 cup (180ml) warm water (about 100\u00b0F/38\u00b0C)\n  - 1/4 cup (60ml) vegetable oil (or melted butter)\n  - 2 large eggs + 1 egg yolk (save the extra egg white for the egg wash)\n\n- **For the Egg Wash:**\n  - 1 egg white\n  - 1 tbsp water\n  - Optional: Sesame seeds or poppy seeds for topping\n\n---\n\n#### **Instructions**\n\n1. **Activate the Yeast:**\n   - In a small bowl, combine the warm water, yeast, and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Let it sit for 5\u201310 minutes until it becomes foamy. This means the yeast is activated.\n\n2. **Make the Dough:**\n   - In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, remaining sugar, and salt.\n   - Add the yeast mixture, oil, and eggs to the flour mixture. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.\n   - Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 8\u201310 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour, one tablespoon at a time.\n\n3. **Let the Dough Rise:**\n   - Place the kneaded dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning it once to coat the surface with oil. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap.\n   - Let the dough rise in a warm place for 1\u20132 hours, or until it has doubled in size.\n\n4. **Shape the Challah:**\n   - Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air. Divide the dough into 3 or 4 equal pieces for braiding.\n   - Roll each piece into a long rope (about 12\u201316 inches long). Pinch the ropes together at one end and braid them. Tuck the ends underneath to give a neat appearance.\n   - Place the braided challah on a parchment-lined baking sheet.\n\n5. **Second Rise:**\n   - Cover the shaped challah with a towel and let it rise again for 30\u201345 minutes, or until slightly puffy.\n\n6. **Prepare the Egg Wash:**\n   - In a small bowl, whisk together the reserved egg white and 1 tablespoon of water. Brush the egg wash generously over the entire challah.\n   - If desired, sprinkle sesame seeds or poppy seeds on top.\n\n7. **Bake:**\n   - Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).\n   - Bake the challah for 25\u201330 minutes, or until it is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.\n   - If the top browns too quickly, tent it loosely with aluminum foil.\n\n8. **Cool and Enjoy:**\n   - Allow the challah to cool on a wire rack before slicing. Serve and enjoy!\n\n---\n\nThis recipe yields one large loaf of challah. You can also divide the dough into smaller portions to make individual challah rolls or mini loaves. Challah is perfect for Shabbat, holidays, or any special occasion!\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need tips on braiding!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1087, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1078, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1071, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1087, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2890, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1078, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2852, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1071, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2957, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 1087, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2404, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 1078, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 2668, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 1071, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 2568, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 1087, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2364, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 1078, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 2705, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 1071, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 2545, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2949, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 2737, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 2911}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 44, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 44, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 65, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 898, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 64, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 889, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 43, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 882, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 54, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 898, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 58, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 889, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 44, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 882, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 55, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 60, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 60, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 60}, "total_time": [57.81855797767639], "llm_time": {"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [7.280203104019165, 8.618068933486938, 4.957237005233765, 5.8905909061431885], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [10.332566022872925, 4.7556188106536865, 5.967705965042114, 5.974265813827515], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [20.0273540019989, 23.653246879577637, 23.2328040599823, 23.910947799682617], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [9.973582029342651]}, "llm_tokens": {"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [56, 56, 56, 56], "completion": [701, 694, 660, 678], "total": [757, 750, 716, 734]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [50, 50, 50, 50], "completion": [769, 615, 648, 664], "total": [819, 665, 698, 714]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [24, 24, 24, 24], "completion": [639, 784, 730, 769], "total": [663, 808, 754, 793]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [27], "completion": [766], "total": [793]}}}

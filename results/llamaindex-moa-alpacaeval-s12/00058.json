It\u2019s light, refreshing, and easy to customize. Traditionally, Okroshka is made with a mix of fresh vegetables, boiled potatoes, eggs, and a choice of protein (like cooked sausage, ham, or chicken) in a tangy base of kvass or kefir. Here's a recipe for you to try:\n\n---\n\n### **Okroshka Recipe (Classic Ukrainian Style)**  \n*Serves: 4-6*\n\n#### **Ingredients**  \n- **For the soup base:**\n  - 4 cups of kefir (or plain yogurt diluted with water to a drinkable consistency)\n  - 1 cup of cold sparkling water (optional, for fizz)\n  - Juice of 1 lemon (adjust to taste)\n  - Salt to taste\n\n- **For the salad mix:**\n  - 2 large potatoes, boiled and peeled\n  - 4 hard-boiled eggs\n  - 1 cup cooked ham, chicken, or sausage (diced)\n  - 1 medium cucumber, diced\n  - 4-5 radishes, thinly sliced\n  - 3-4 green onions, finely chopped\n  - 2-3 tbsp fresh dill, finely chopped\n  - 2 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped\n\n#### **Optional Toppings:**\n- A dollop of sour cream\n- Extra dill or parsley for garnish\n\n---\n\n#### **Instructions**\n\n1. **Prepare the ingredients:**\n   - Boil the potatoes in their skins until tender, let them cool, then peel and dice them into small cubes.\n   - Hard-boil the eggs, peel, and chop them finely.\n   - Dice the cooked ham, chicken, or sausage into bite-sized pieces.\n   - Chop the cucumber, radishes, green onions, dill, and parsley.\n\n2. **Combine the salad mix:**\n   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the diced potatoes, eggs, protein, cucumber, radishes, green onions, dill, and parsley. Mix gently to evenly distribute the ingredients.\n\n3. **Prepare the soup base:**\n   - In a separate bowl or pitcher, whisk together the kefir, lemon juice, and sparkling water (if using). Season with salt to taste.\n   - Adjust the tanginess or thickness of the base by adding more lemon juice or water as desired.\n\n4. **Assemble the Okroshka:**\n   - Divide the salad mixture into individual serving bowls.\n   - Pour the chilled kefir soup base over the salad until it\u2019s fully submerged.\n   - Stir gently to combine.\n\n5. **Chill and serve:**\n   - Let the Okroshka rest in the refrigerator for at least 15-20 minutes to cool and allow the flavors to meld.\n   - Serve cold, garnished with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of fresh dill or parsley.\n\n---\n\n#### **Tips:**\n- If you want a more traditional tangy flavor, use kvass (a fermented bread drink) instead of kefir for the base.\n- For a vegetarian version, skip the meat and add more vegetables like bell peppers or peas.\n- Adjust the proportions of the ingredients to suit your taste\u2014Okroshka is very forgiving!\n\nEnjoy hosting your guests and introducing them to this delicious Ukrainian dish! \ud83d\ude0a", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1240, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1231, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1224, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1240, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2111, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1231, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 1868, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1224, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 1889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 1240, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2178, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 1231, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 1835, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 1224, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 2184, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 1240, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 2026, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 1231, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2358, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 1224, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2593, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 2413, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 2406, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 2275}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 53, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 41, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 43, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 898, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 51, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 889, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 39, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 882, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 54, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 898, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 44, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 889, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 54, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 882, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 61, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 58, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 57, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 55}, "total_time": [52.65984010696411], "llm_time": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.5922300815582275, 4.389494895935059, 4.913614988327026, 9.066313982009888], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.1319639682769775, 5.17927098274231, 5.403501987457275, 4.887531042098999], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [15.251466989517212, 20.916059017181396, 19.796052932739258, 23.092299938201904], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [9.152514934539795]}, "llm_tokens": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [79, 79, 79, 79], "completion": [533, 541, 625, 616], "total": [612, 620, 704, 695]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [85, 85, 85, 85], "completion": [437, 448, 445, 475], "total": [522, 533, 530, 560]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [53, 53, 53, 53], "completion": [636, 690, 628, 607], "total": [689, 743, 681, 660]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [57], "completion": [696], "total": [753]}}}

Koldsk\u00e5l is a traditional Danish cold buttermilk dessert soup that is perfect for summer. It's light, refreshing, and quite easy to make. Here's a classic recipe for Koldsk\u00e5l:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 1 liter (about 4 cups) of buttermilk\n- 250 ml (about 1 cup) of plain yogurt or Greek yogurt\n- 3 egg yolks\n- 100 grams (about 1/2 cup) of sugar\n- 1 tablespoon of vanilla sugar or 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract\n- Juice of half a lemon (optional, for extra tanginess)\n- A pinch of salt\n\n### For Serving:\n- Kammerjunker (Danish vanilla biscuits) or crushed graham crackers\n- Fresh berries (such as strawberries or raspberries), for garnish (optional)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Egg Mixture:**\n   - In a mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, vanilla sugar (or extract), and a pinch of salt until the mixture is pale and creamy. This should take a few minutes.\n\n2. **Combine with Dairy:**\n   - Gradually add the buttermilk and yogurt into the egg mixture, whisking continuously to ensure a smooth consistency. If you like a bit of tang, add the lemon juice at this stage.\n\n3. **Chill:**\n   - Once everything is well combined, cover the bowl and refrigerate the Koldsk\u00e5l for at least an hour. This allows the flavors to meld together and the soup to chill properly.\n\n4. **Serve:**\n   - Before serving, give the Koldsk\u00e5l a good stir. Pour it into bowls and top with Kammerjunker or crushed graham crackers for a bit of crunch. Add fresh berries if you desire.\n\n5. **Enjoy:**\n   - Koldsk\u00e5l is best enjoyed cold and can be served as a dessert or a refreshing snack on a warm day.\n\n### Tips:\n- Feel free to adjust the sweetness to your liking by adding more or less sugar.\n- Some variations of Koldsk\u00e5l include the addition of a bit of elderflower cordial for extra flavor.\n- If you prefer a thicker consistency, use Greek yogurt instead of regular plain yogurt.\n\nThis delightful dish is sure to impress your guests with its unique flavor and simplicity.

It's typically filled with a mixture of seasoned meats and spices, offering a delightful blend of flavors. Here's a recipe for making Kubdari:\n\n### Ingredients\n\n#### Dough:\n- 4 cups all-purpose flour\n- 1 cup warm water\n- 1 packet (about 2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast\n- 1 teaspoon sugar\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n\n#### Filling:\n- 1 lb beef or pork (or a mix), finely chopped or ground\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 medium onion, finely chopped\n- 1 teaspoon coriander seeds, crushed\n- 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n- 1 teaspoon paprika\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Optional: a pinch of crushed dried fenugreek or blue fenugreek (known as utskho suneli)\n- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### Prepare the Dough:\n1. In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water and then add the yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.\n2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and vegetable oil. Mix until a dough forms.\n3. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.\n4. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm spot for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until it doubles in size.\n\n#### Prepare the Filling:\n1. In a mixing bowl, combine the meat, garlic, onion, coriander seeds, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper. Add the vegetable oil and mix well. Adjust seasoning if needed.\n\n#### Assemble the Kubdari:\n1. Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n2. Punch down the risen dough and divide it into 4 equal parts.\n3. Roll each part into a circular shape, about 8 inches in diameter.\n4. Place a portion of the meat filling in the center of each dough circle.\n5. Gather the edges of the dough towards the center, pinching to seal and form a round, stuffed bread. Flatten gently to form a disk.\n6. Place the Kubdari on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n7. Make a small hole in the center of each Kubdari to allow steam to escape during baking.\n8. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes or until the bread is golden brown and fully cooked.\n9. Once done, you can brush the top with a bit of butter for extra flavor and shine.\n\n#### Serve:\nKubdari is best enjoyed warm. Serve it as a main dish or alongside other Georgian dishes for a delightful meal. Enjoy the unique flavors of Svaneti!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1239, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1230, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1223, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1239, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2306, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1230, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2044, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1223, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2859, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 1239, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2391, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 1230, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 2707, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 1223, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 2047, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 1239, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2463, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 1230, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 2279, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 1223, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 2292, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2645, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 2779, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 2902}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 41, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 38, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 71, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 898, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 57, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 889, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 43, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 882, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 41, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 898, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 61, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 889, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 39, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 882, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 62, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 66, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 62, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 70}, "total_time": [54.94143795967102], "llm_time": {"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.119770050048828, 4.2405009269714355, 6.420228004455566, 6.823171854019165], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.35753607749939, 4.578255891799927, 3.9979920387268066, 6.471606016159058], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [17.759854078292847, 23.264972925186157, 20.336930990219116, 28.121296167373657], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.262534856796265]}, "llm_tokens": {"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [85, 85, 85, 85], "completion": [587, 515, 676, 567], "total": [672, 600, 761, 652]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [79, 79, 79, 79], "completion": [709, 601, 492, 574], "total": [788, 680, 571, 653]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [53, 53, 53, 53], "completion": [651, 696, 752, 767], "total": [704, 749, 805, 820]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [57], "completion": [615], "total": [672]}}}

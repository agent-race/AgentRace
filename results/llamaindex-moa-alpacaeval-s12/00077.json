It consists of thinly sliced veal served cold with a creamy tuna-based sauce. Although its origins trace back to Italian immigrants, it has become a beloved dish in Uruguay, especially during Christmas or New Year's celebrations. Here's a recipe for you to try:\n\n---\n\n### **Vitel Ton\u00e9 (Uruguayan Style)**\n\n#### **Ingredients:**\n**For the veal:**\n- 2 pounds (1 kg) veal eye of round or similar cut\n- 1 large carrot, peeled\n- 1 onion, peeled and halved\n- 2 celery stalks\n- 2 bay leaves\n- 1 teaspoon black peppercorns\n- Salt, to taste\n- Water (enough to cover the meat)\n\n**For the sauce:**\n- 1 cup mayonnaise\n- 1 cup plain Greek yogurt or sour cream\n- 1 can (5-6 ounces / 150-170 g) tuna in oil, drained\n- 4-5 anchovy fillets (optional, for extra umami)\n- 2 tablespoons capers (plus extra for garnish)\n- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard\n- Juice of 1 lemon\n- 1/4 cup olive oil (if needed, for consistency)\n- Salt and pepper, to taste\n\n**For garnish:**\n- Capers\n- Hard-boiled eggs, sliced\n- Fresh parsley, chopped\n\n---\n\n#### **Instructions:**\n\n1. **Cook the veal:**\n   - Place the veal in a large pot. Add the carrot, onion, celery, bay leaves, peppercorns, and a generous pinch of salt. Cover with water and bring to a boil.\n   - Once boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for about 1.5\u20132 hours, or until the veal is tender. Skim off any foam that rises to the surface during cooking.\n   - Once cooked, remove the veal from the pot and let it cool completely. Strain the broth and reserve a cup for later.\n\n2. **Prepare the sauce:**\n   - In a blender or food processor, combine the mayonnaise, yogurt (or sour cream), tuna, anchovy fillets (if using), capers, mustard, and lemon juice.\n   - Blend until smooth. If the sauce is too thick, add a little of the reserved veal broth or olive oil to reach your desired consistency.\n   - Taste and adjust with salt and pepper as needed.\n\n3. **Assemble the dish:**\n   - Once the veal is completely cool, slice it thinly (about 1/8 inch or 3 mm thick).\n   - Arrange the slices on a serving platter, slightly overlapping each other.\n   - Pour the tuna sauce generously over the veal slices, ensuring they are well-covered.\n\n4. **Garnish and serve:**\n   - Garnish with capers, slices of hard-boiled egg, and a sprinkle of chopped parsley.\n   - Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours (or overnight) to allow the flavors to meld.\n   - Serve cold as an appetizer or main dish, accompanied by crusty bread or a simple green salad.\n\n---\n\nThis dish is perfect for entertaining because it can be prepared in advance and served cold, giving you more time to enjoy with your guests. \u00a1Buen provecho!

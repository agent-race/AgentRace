{"query": "instruction: When were smart phones first made?", "answer": "The first smartphone was the IBM Simon, which was released in 1994.", "result": "assistant: The concept of a \"smartphone\" dates back to the early 1990s, although the devices at the time were vastly different from today\u2019s modern smartphones. Here\u2019s a timeline of significant milestones in the development of smartphones:\n\n### **1992 \u2013 IBM Simon**\nThe IBM Simon Personal Communicator is widely considered the first smartphone. It was unveiled in 1992 and released for sale in 1994. The IBM Simon combined a mobile phone with PDA (personal digital assistant) features, including a touchscreen, email, calendar, address book, and even apps. However, it was bulky and limited by the technology of the time.\n\n### **1996 \u2013 Nokia 9000 Communicator**\nThe Nokia 9000 Communicator was one of the earliest devices to combine phone functionality with computer-like features, such as email, web browsing, and fax. It had a physical keyboard and gained popularity among business professionals.\n\n### **2000 \u2013 Ericsson R380**\nThe Ericsson R380 was the first device officially marketed as a \"smartphone.\" It ran on the Symbian operating system and offered limited touchscreen functionality along with phone features. The R380 was compact compared to earlier devices, making it more practical.\n\n### **2007 \u2013 Apple iPhone**\nThe modern era of smartphones truly began with the launch of the **Apple iPhone** in 2007. The iPhone revolutionized the industry by introducing a sleek touchscreen interface, intuitive design, and the concept of an app-based ecosystem via the App Store (introduced in 2008). Apple\u2019s innovation set the standard for future smartphones.\n\n### **2008 \u2013 Android Smartphones**\nFollowing the success of the iPhone, Google released the first Android-powered smartphone, the **HTC Dream (T-Mobile G1)**, in 2008. Android became a direct competitor to Apple\u2019s iOS and eventually surpassed it in global market share.\n\n---\n\nWhile IBM Simon was the first smartphone in concept, the iPhone is often credited with defining the modern smartphone experience, thanks to its user-friendly interface, powerful features, and widespread adoption.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1048, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1039, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1032, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1048, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 973, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1039, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 954, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1032, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 1194, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 1048, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 1547, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 1039, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 1385, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 1032, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 905, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 1048, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 1481, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 1039, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 1005, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 1032, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 1466, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 840, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 1274, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 1148}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 13, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 13, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 19, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 898, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 21, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 889, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 30, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 882, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 13, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 898, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 21, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 889, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 19, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 882, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 25, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 15, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 20, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 27}, "total_time": [31.61769199371338], "llm_time": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [2.900789976119995, 6.76350998878479, 2.479024887084961, 6.4381489753723145], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [6.3432838916778564, 8.70218300819397, 3.8978660106658936, 2.4038238525390625], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [9.935916900634766, 8.712921857833862, 13.07432508468628, 11.622743844985962], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.395914077758789]}, "llm_tokens": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [36, 36, 36, 36], "completion": [204, 361, 200, 182], "total": [240, 397, 236, 218]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [42, 42, 42, 42], "completion": [202, 248, 306, 205], "total": [244, 290, 348, 247]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [10, 10, 10, 10], "completion": [344, 335, 296, 267], "total": [354, 345, 306, 277]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [14], "completion": [418], "total": [432]}}}

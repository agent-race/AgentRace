Here are a few:\n\n1. **Krampus Night (Austria, Bavaria, and other Alpine regions)**: On December 5th, the eve of St. Nicholas Day, a creature known as Krampus accompanies St. Nicholas. While St. Nicholas rewards good children, Krampus is said to punish those who have misbehaved, and people dress up as this fearsome figure to scare children.\n\n2. **Night of the Radishes (Oaxaca, Mexico)**: On December 23rd, the city of Oaxaca holds a festival where intricate scenes are carved out of radishes. These displays often depict nativity scenes and other Christmas themes, and it's a popular event attracting many visitors.\n\n3. **Catalonian Caga Ti\u00f3 (Spain)**: This tradition involves a wooden log, often with a painted face, that is cared for by children in the lead-up to Christmas. On Christmas Eve, children hit the log with sticks while singing a special song, and the log \"poops\" out presents and sweets.\n\n4. **KFC Christmas Dinner (Japan)**: Due to a successful marketing campaign in the 1970s, many families in Japan celebrate Christmas by eating KFC. It's so popular that people often place orders weeks in advance to ensure they can get their meal.\n\n5. **Broom Hiding (Norway)**: In Norway, it's traditional to hide all the brooms in the house on Christmas Eve to prevent witches and evil spirits from stealing them to ride on.\n\n6. **Spider Webs on Christmas Trees (Ukraine)**: Ukrainians often decorate their Christmas trees with artificial spider webs. This tradition stems from a legend about a poor widow who couldn't afford decorations for her tree, and spiders in her house created beautiful webs to adorn it.\n\n7. **Mari Lwyd (Wales)**: This tradition involves a group of people carrying a horse's skull on a stick, adorned with ribbons and a white sheet, from house to house. The group exchanges rhymes with the occupants in a sort of singing competition, and if they win, they're invited inside for food and drinks.\n\nThese traditions add a unique and diverse flavor to the holiday season, reflecting different cultural beliefs and practices.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1055, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1046, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1039, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1055, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2359, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1046, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2946, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1039, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2738, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 1055, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2197, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 1046, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 2002, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 1039, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 2520, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 1055, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2525, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 1046, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 2854, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 1039, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 2347, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2904, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 3552, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 2775}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 27, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 35, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 40, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 898, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 25, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 889, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 28, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 882, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 42, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 898, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 41, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 889, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 31, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 882, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 38, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 41, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 56, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 45}, "total_time": [57.58847498893738], "llm_time": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [6.623323917388916, 3.906093120574951, 3.4756698608398438, 5.603929042816162], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [6.789216041564941, 7.952620029449463, 6.885775804519653, 8.026157140731812], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [20.942075967788696, 28.939815998077393, 31.358824014663696, 28.061534881591797], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [6.61850905418396]}, "llm_tokens": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [36, 36, 36, 36], "completion": [515, 461, 419, 547], "total": [551, 497, 455, 583]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [42, 42, 42, 42], "completion": [668, 620, 580, 655], "total": [710, 662, 622, 697]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [10, 10, 10, 10], "completion": [585, 676, 899, 702], "total": [595, 686, 909, 712]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [14], "completion": [463], "total": [477]}}}

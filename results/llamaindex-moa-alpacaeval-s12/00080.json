Here\u2019s a general guide to help you address the issue:\n\n1. **Safety First**: Ensure you have a stable ladder, and wear slip-resistant shoes. Avoid working on the roof during wet conditions or if you feel unsafe.\n\n2. **Identify the Leak Source**: \n   - Look for water stains on the ceiling or walls inside your home.\n   - Inspect the attic for signs of water entry, such as damp insulation or mold.\n   - On the roof, check for damaged, missing, or curling shingles. Also, look at flashing around chimneys, vents, and other protrusions.\n\n3. **Temporary Fixes**:\n   - **Tarps**: Place a tarp over the leaking area as a temporary measure until you can make permanent repairs.\n   - **Roofing Cement**: Apply roofing cement to small holes or gaps around flashing and other roof fixtures.\n\n4. **Permanent Repairs**:\n   - **Replace Damaged Shingles**: Remove the damaged shingles and replace them with new ones. Secure them with nails and seal with roofing cement.\n   - **Repair Flashing**: If the flashing is damaged, remove the old material and install new flashing, ensuring it is properly sealed against water intrusion.\n   - **Seal Cracks**: Use roof sealant or caulk to seal any visible cracks or gaps.\n\n5. **Prevent Future Leaks**:\n   - Regularly inspect your roof and clear debris such as leaves or branches.\n   - Ensure gutters are clean so water can drain properly.\n   - Trim trees near your roof to prevent damage from falling branches.\n\n6. **Consider Professional Help**:\n   - If the damage is extensive or you\u2019re unsure about the repairs, it\u2019s wise to consult a professional roofer for an inspection and repair.\n\nRemember, addressing a leaking roof promptly can prevent further damage to your home\u2019s interior and structure.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1043, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1034, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1027, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1043, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2665, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1034, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2864, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1027, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 3602, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 1043, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2611, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 1034, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 3415, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 1027, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 2599, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 1043, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 3035, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 1034, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2311, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 1027, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 2937, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2552, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 2068, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 2478}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 39, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 50, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 77, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 898, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 43, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 889, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 50, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 882, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 72, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 898, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 74, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 889, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 53, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 882, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 50, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 54, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 53, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 54}, "total_time": [57.898635149002075], "llm_time": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [6.089979887008667, 4.760961055755615, 5.580351829528809, 4.819921016693115], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [7.996448993682861, 9.271267890930176, 7.358630895614624, 7.4410529136657715], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [27.84484100341797, 21.833868980407715, 21.317455053329468, 19.76019287109375], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [10.262571096420288]}, "llm_tokens": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [37, 37, 37, 37], "completion": [590, 574, 732, 653], "total": [627, 611, 769, 690]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [43, 43, 43, 43], "completion": [621, 803, 592, 693], "total": [664, 846, 635, 736]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [11, 11, 11, 11], "completion": [528, 587, 487, 581], "total": [539, 598, 498, 592]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [15], "completion": [396], "total": [411]}}}

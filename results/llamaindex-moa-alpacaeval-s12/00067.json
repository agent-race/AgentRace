Crisco is often used in place of butter for frosting because it holds its shape well, especially in warmer temperatures, and creates a pure white base that can be easily colored with food coloring.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple recipe for frosting using Crisco:\n\n---\n\n### **Ingredients:**\n- 1 cup Crisco (vegetable shortening)\n- 1 teaspoon clear vanilla extract (or regular vanilla extract; clear vanilla keeps the frosting white)\n- 4 cups powdered sugar (confectioners\u2019 sugar), sifted\n- 2\u20134 tablespoons milk or water (adjust for consistency)\n- Optional: A pinch of salt (to balance sweetness)\n- Optional: Food coloring (if desired)\n\n---\n\n### **Instructions:**\n\n1. **Cream the Crisco:**\n   - In a large mixing bowl, beat the Crisco with a hand mixer or stand mixer on medium speed until it becomes smooth and creamy (about 2\u20133 minutes).\n\n2. **Add Vanilla:**\n   - Mix in the vanilla extract until well combined.\n\n3. **Incorporate the Powdered Sugar:**\n   - Gradually add the powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time, mixing on low speed to avoid a sugar cloud. Once incorporated, increase the speed to medium and beat until smooth.\n\n4. **Adjust the Consistency:**\n   - Add milk or water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing well after each addition. Continue until the frosting reaches your desired consistency. For a stiffer frosting (good for piping), use less liquid. For a smoother, spreadable frosting, use more.\n\n5. **Add Salt (Optional):**\n   - If the frosting is too sweet, add a tiny pinch of salt and mix well. Taste and adjust as needed.\n\n6. **Color the Frosting (Optional):**\n   - If you want to color your frosting, add a few drops of food coloring and mix until evenly blended. Add more drops as needed to achieve your desired color.\n\n7. **Use or Store the Frosting:**\n   - Use the frosting immediately to decorate cakes, cupcakes, or cookies. If not using right away, store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days or refrigerate for up to a week. Let chilled frosting come to room temperature and re-whip before using.\n\n---\n\n### **Tips:**\n- If you want a richer flavor, you can replace some of the Crisco with butter (e.g., \u00bd cup Crisco + \u00bd cup butter). This will make it slightly less white, but it will add a buttery taste.\n- For chocolate frosting, add \u00bd cup unsweetened cocoa powder and an extra tablespoon or two of milk.\n- For a super-smooth frosting, sift the powdered sugar before adding it to the Crisco.\n\nEnjoy your delicious Crisco frosting for decorating your baked goods! \ud83c\udf82", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1046, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1037, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1030, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1046, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2346, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1037, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2777, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1030, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2645, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 1046, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2143, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 1037, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 2411, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 1030, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 2471, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 1046, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2075, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 1037, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 2817, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 1030, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 2194, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 1949, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 1867, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 2048}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 47, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 43, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 39, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 898, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 41, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 889, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 45, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 882, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 38, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 898, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 42, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 889, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 41, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 882, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 49, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 40, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 35, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 38}, "total_time": [52.19200396537781], "llm_time": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.065485000610352, 3.9393739700317383, 3.976499080657959, 4.4369049072265625], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.310871124267578, 5.969135999679565, 6.981451034545898, 5.842379093170166], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [17.24574589729309, 16.487838983535767, 15.699684143066406, 24.626876831054688], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [8.727705955505371]}, "llm_tokens": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [36, 36, 36, 36], "completion": [531, 489, 540, 489], "total": [567, 525, 576, 525]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [42, 42, 42, 42], "completion": [619, 584, 559, 639], "total": [661, 626, 601, 681]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [10, 10, 10, 10], "completion": [520, 481, 448, 497], "total": [530, 491, 458, 507]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [14], "completion": [606], "total": [620]}}}

Fl\u00e6skesteg is a traditional Danish dish that translates to \"roast pork.\" It's a beloved classic, especially during the holiday season, and it's known for its crispy crackling and flavorful meat. Here's a recipe to help you make an authentic and delicious Fl\u00e6skesteg:\n\n---\n\n### **Fl\u00e6skesteg (Danish Roast Pork)**\n**Serves:** 6-8  \n**Prep Time:** 15 minutes  \n**Cook Time:** 1.5\u20132 hours\n\n#### **Ingredients:**\n- 4 to 5 lbs (2 to 2.5 kg) pork roast (preferably a cut with the skin, such as pork loin or pork shoulder)\n- 1 tablespoon coarse sea salt\n- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n- 2-3 cups water\n- 2-3 bay leaves\n- 3-4 whole cloves (optional)\n- 1 onion, roughly chopped\n- 2-3 carrots, roughly chopped\n- 2-3 celery stalks, roughly chopped\n\n#### **For the Gravy (optional):**\n- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n- 1 cup pork drippings (from the roasting pan)\n- 1-2 cups chicken or pork stock\n- Salt and pepper, to taste\n\n---\n\n#### **Instructions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Pork:**\n   - Preheat your oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C).\n   - If the pork skin isn't already scored, use a sharp knife to carefully make shallow cuts in a crisscross pattern or parallel lines about 1/4 inch apart. Be sure not to cut into the meat itself\u2014only the skin and fat layer.\n   - Rub the pork skin generously with coarse sea salt, making sure the salt gets into the scored slits. Then sprinkle the meat with freshly ground black pepper.\n\n2. **Set Up the Roasting Pan:**\n   - Place the chopped onion, carrots, and celery in the bottom of a roasting pan. Add the bay leaves and cloves (if using) for extra flavor.\n   - Place the pork roast on top of the vegetables, skin side up. Pour water into the pan, ensuring the bottom is covered but without submerging the pork.\n\n3. **Roast the Pork:**\n   - Place the roasting pan in the oven and roast at 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C) for 20-30 minutes to help the skin begin to crisp up.\n   - Reduce the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) and continue roasting for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 145\u00b0F (63\u00b0C). Baste the pork occasionally with the pan juices to keep it moist.\n\n4. **Achieving Crispy Crackling:**\n   - If the crackling (the crispy skin) isn\u2019t fully crisped by the end of cooking, increase the oven temperature to 475\u00b0F (245\u00b0C) or use the broiler for a few minutes. Watch it carefully to avoid burning.\n\n5. **Rest the Meat:**\n   - Remove the roast from the oven and let it rest for 15-20 minutes before carving. This allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring tender meat.\n\n6. **Make the Gravy (Optional):**\n   - Strain the pan drippings into a saucepan, discarding the vegetables.\n   - In a small bowl, mix the flour with a bit of cold water to form a smooth paste. Whisk this into the saucepan with the drippings over medium heat.\n   - Gradually add stock and simmer until the gravy thickens. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\n7. **Serve:**\n   - Slice the pork into thin pieces, ensuring each slice has a bit of crispy crackling.\n   - Serve with traditional Danish accompaniments such as boiled or caramelized potatoes (brunede kartofler), red cabbage (r\u00f8dk\u00e5l), and the gravy.\n\n---\n\nEnjoy your Fl\u00e6skesteg and impress your guests with this iconic Danish dish!

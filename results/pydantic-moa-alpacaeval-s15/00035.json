It is described in the works of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato and is a popular subject in literature, art, and popular culture.", "result": "Atlantis is a legendary island mentioned in ancient texts and myths, most notably by the Greek philosopher Plato. According to Plato, Atlantis was a powerful and advanced civilization that existed around 9,600 BCE and was situated beyond the \"Pillars of Hercules,\" which is now known as the Strait of Gibraltar.\n\nThe story of Atlantis is primarily described in two of Plato's dialogues, \"Timaeus\" and \"Critias.\" According to these works, Atlantis was a large island with a powerful and technologically advanced civilization. The Atlanteans had conquered parts of Western Europe and Africa before a catastrophic event, believed to be a natural disaster like a tsunami or earthquake, led to the island's destruction, causing it to sink into the ocean.\n\nThe existence of Atlantis has been debated for centuries. Some consider it a historical reality, others view it as a myth or allegory, and some believe it may be a mixture of both, possibly based on real ancient events or civilizations.\n\nDespite numerous theories and explorations, no conclusive evidence of Atlantis has been found, and its story continues to be a subject of fascination and speculation in modern culture.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [6.480331897735596], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [6.465653896331787]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [326], "completion": [230], "total": [556]}}}

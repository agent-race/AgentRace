Optionally, add white wine for flavor.\n   - Cover with water and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer gently for 1.5\u20132 hours, or until tender.\n   - Remove the veal and let it cool. Strain and reserve a small amount of the cooking broth for the sauce if desired.\n\n2. **Slice the Veal:**\n   - Once cooled, slice the veal thinly (around \u00bc inch slices). This step is key for the presentation of the dish.\n\n3. **Prepare the Tuna Sauce:**\n   - In a blender or food processor, combine tuna, anchovies (if using), egg yolks, capers, mustard, mayonnaise, and lemon juice. Blend until smooth.\n   - Gradually add heavy cream or milk to adjust the sauce's texture and consistency. You want it creamy but not too thick. Optionally, drizzle in some veal broth for enhanced flavor.\n\n4. **Assemble the Dish:**\n   - Arrange the sliced veal on a serving platter, slightly overlapping each piece.\n   - Pour the tuna sauce generously over the meat, ensuring it covers the slices evenly.\n\n5. **Garnish and Chill:**\n   - Garnish with extra capers, lemon slices, and hard-boiled egg rounds. Sprinkle parsley on top for a pop of color.\n   - Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours (or overnight), allowing the flavors to meld.\n\n6. **Serve:**\n   - Serve chilled as an appetizer or main course. Accompany with boiled potatoes, fresh baguette, or a mixed green salad.\n\n---\n\n### **Recipe Notes:**\n- **Substitute Meats:** If veal isn't available, you can substitute with thinly sliced beef, turkey, or chicken.\n- **Advance Prep:** This dish improves in flavor when prepared a day in advance, making it perfect for gatherings.\n- **Accompaniments:** The dish pairs well with crusty bread or baby potatoes to soak up the creamy tuna sauce.\n\n---\n\nEnjoy this delectable **Uruguayan Vitel Ton\u00e9**, a dish that combines simplicity and rich, complex flavors perfect for entertaining your guests!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 48, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 59, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 62, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 59, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 42, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2564, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 3101, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 1623, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2230, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 3061}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 0}, "total_time": [108.87977194786072], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [4.118898153305054, 76.87035179138184], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.626194000244141, 5.16756796836853], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.209486961364746, 11.295446157455444], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [27.835047006607056]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [374, 4041], "completion": [163, 805], "total": [537, 4846]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [35, 33], "completion": [633, 782], "total": [668, 815]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [58, 60], "completion": [420, 549], "total": [478, 609]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [29], "completion": [816], "total": [845]}}}

Enjoy!", "result": "Here is a compiled recipe for Canjeero, a traditional Somali flatbread:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- **2 cups** teff flour (you can use a combination of teff and all-purpose flour)\n- **1/2 tsp** active dry yeast (optional, for fermentation)\n- **1/2 tsp** salt\n- **1 tsp** sugar (optional, to aid fermentation)\n- **2 1/2 cups** warm water (adjust as needed)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Batter:**\n   - In a large bowl, mix the teff flour, salt, and sugar.\n   - Gradually add warm water while stirring to form a smooth, thin batter similar to pancake batter.\n   - Optional: Add yeast for a more pronounced sour flavor and to expedite fermentation.\n\n2. **Ferment the Batter:**\n   - Cover the bowl with a clean cloth and let it ferment at room temperature for 6-12 hours, or overnight, until the batter is bubbly and has a sour aroma. The longer it ferments, the tangier the flavor becomes.\n   - Note: If using yeast, you may ferment for a shorter period.\n\n3. **Cook the Canjeero:**\n   - Stir the fermented batter gently.\n   - Heat a non-stick skillet or traditional Somali tawa over medium heat without greasing.\n   - Pour a ladleful of batter into the pan, swirling it to form a thin, even circle.\n   - Cover the pan and cook for 1-2 minutes, until small holes form and the edges lift slightly. Canjeero is only cooked on one side.\n   - Remove carefully and repeat with remaining batter.\n\n4. **Serve:**\n   - Canjeero is traditionally served with stews, curries, or drizzled with honey and ghee for breakfast. It can also be paired with eggs or meats for a hearty meal.\n\n### Tips:\n- Use high-quality teff flour for the best flavor.\n- Adjust the water based on humidity; the batter should be pourable but not too runny.\n- It\u2019s best eaten fresh, but leftovers can be refrigerated and gently reheated.\n\nEnjoy your homemade Canjeero and explore its versatility with various Somali dishes!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 57, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 57, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 57, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 57, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 57, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 57, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 57, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 57, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 57, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 57, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 57, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 57, "Root Agent_to_Agent 13": 57, "Root Agent_to_Agent 14": 57, "Root Agent_to_Agent 15": 57, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2048, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 2171, "Agent 14_to_Root Agent": 2171, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2294, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 2247, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2262, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2262, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 2701, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 2290, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 2221, "Agent 15_to_Root Agent": 2593, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2513, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 2142, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2565, "Agent 13_to_Root Agent": 2502}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 13": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 14": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 15": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 14_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 15_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 13_to_Root Agent": 0}, "total_time": [104.17033290863037], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [6.762901067733765, 29.090532779693604], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.110841989517212, 4.229000091552734, 4.201283931732178, 4.667029142379761, 4.689015865325928], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.8856589794158936, 4.907041072845459, 7.248338937759399, 18.42009711265564, 68.18946099281311], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [16.292623043060303, 18.748723030090332, 19.1672101020813, 20.201478958129883, 24.190593957901]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [372, 10210], "completion": [452, 457], "total": [824, 10667]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [36, 36, 36, 36, 36], "completion": [502, 558, 558, 591, 571], "total": [538, 594, 594, 627, 607]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [58, 58, 58, 58, 58], "completion": [550, 550, 666, 543, 642], "total": [608, 608, 724, 601, 700]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [26, 26, 26, 26, 26], "completion": [568, 648, 648, 542, 648], "total": [594, 674, 674, 568, 674]}}}

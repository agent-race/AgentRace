{"query": "instruction: Hi, I'd like to play ice hockey. Can you explain how the game works?", "answer": "Sure! Ice hockey is a team sport played on ice. It is usually played between two teams of six players each, but can also be played with fewer players. The objective of the game is to score goals by shooting a hard rubber puck into the opposing team's net. Players attempt to control the puck using a hockey stick and can pass it to teammates or take shots at the goal. The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins.", "result": "Here's a comprehensive overview of ice hockey as requested, combining insights from multiple agents:\n\n### Basic Rules\nIce hockey is a high-speed sport played on ice with the primary objective of scoring more goals than the opposing team. Gameplay includes three periods of 20 minutes each, with teams consisting of six players on the ice per side. Players use sticks to shoot and pass a rubber puck, aiming to score goals. The game involves face-offs to start play and penalties for rule infractions, such as tripping or roughing.\n\n### Equipment\nEssential gear includes ice skates, helmets, gloves, shoulder pads, sticks, and a puck. Goalies require specific equipment like masks and pads for added protection. Safety and performance are crucial, so equipment must fit well and be in good condition.\n\n### Team Positions\nTeams have forwards (center, left wing, right wing) focused on offense, defensemen (stay-at-home and offensive types) focused on defense, and a goaltender who defends the net. Each position has distinct responsibilities, such as scoring, defending, and creating plays.\n\n### Objectives\nThe main goal is to outscore the opponent by controlling the puck, generating scoring chances, and successfully defending one's own goal. Teams use strategy and skill to outmaneuver opponents on the ice.\n\n### Scoring System\nGoals are scored when the puck crosses the goal line between the posts and under the crossbar, directed by an attacking player. Assists are awarded to players who helped set up the goal. Special types of goals include empty net goals and game-winning goals determined in overtime or shootouts.\n\nBy understanding these key elements, you'll gain a solid foundation in how ice hockey is played.

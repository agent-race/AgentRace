This gives better control.\n3. **Rocking Motion to Cut**:\n   - Use a smooth, rocking motion with the knife's tip touching the board while cutting. This keeps your movements controlled and precise.\n\n### **Safety Practices**\n1. **Cut Away from Your Body**:\n   - Always cut in the direction away from yourself to reduce the likelihood of injury.\n2. **Keep Full Focus**:\n   - Avoid distractions; don\u2019t talk, check your phone, or multitask while cutting.\n3. **Keep Ingredients Steady**:\n   - Make sure the food isn\u2019t sliding around. Stabilize it firmly with your non-dominant hand.\n\n### **Enhancements for Extra Safety**\n1. **Knife Guards or Finger Guards**:\n   - Use protective tools like knife guards or finger shields if you're new to dicing or uneasy.\n2. **Take Your Time**:\n   - Rushing increases the chance of accidents. Dice slowly and deliberately.\n3. **First Aid Preparedness**:\n   - Keep a first aid kit in your kitchen in case of minor accidents.\n\nBy practicing consistently, you can improve your dicing skills while ensuring safety. Remember, preparation, focus, and proper technique are key to avoiding cuts while enjoying your cooking experience!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 48, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 52, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 67, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 68, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 47, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2187, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2355, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2318, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2505, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2041}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 0, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 0}, "total_time": [69.2264928817749], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [2.3562679290771484, 44.47058296203613], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.670557975769043, 3.827805995941162], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [7.43405294418335, 8.697942018508911], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [22.34109401702881]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [330, 3151], "completion": [150, 471], "total": [480, 3622]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [32, 33], "completion": [472, 500], "total": [504, 533]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [58, 55], "completion": [493, 548], "total": [551, 603]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [25], "completion": [472], "total": [497]}}}

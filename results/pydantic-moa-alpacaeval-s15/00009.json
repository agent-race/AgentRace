Dough Preparation**\n1. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.\n2. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Gradually add the yeast mixture along with the vegetable oil. Mix until a dough forms.\n3. Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.\n4. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until it doubles in size.\n\n#### **2. Prepare the Filling**\n1. Combine the meat, chopped onion, garlic, cumin, coriander, black pepper, salt, and optional cinnamon in a mixing bowl.\n2. Add the lemon juice and cilantro for extra flavor, mixing thoroughly.\n3. Let the filling rest for 10-15 minutes so all flavors meld.\n\n#### **3. Assemble the Kubdari**\n1. Divide the dough into 4-6 equal portions, depending on the desired size.\n2. Roll each portion into a circular shape (about 8-10 inches in diameter).\n3. Place a generous amount of the filling in the center of the dough. Bring the edges together to seal, forming a pouch.\n4.

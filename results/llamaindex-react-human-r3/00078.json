{"query": "\ndef hex_key(num):\n    \"\"\"You have been tasked to write a function that receives \n    a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal \n    digits that are primes (prime number, or a prime, is a natural number \n    greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers).\n    Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.\n    Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...\n    So you have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, \n    B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13).\n    Note: you may assume the input is always correct or empty string, \n    and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.\n    Examples:\n    For num = \"AB\" the output should be 1.\n    For num = \"1077E\" the output should be 2.\n    For num = \"ABED1A33\" the output should be 4.\n    For num = \"123456789ABCDEF0\" the output should be 6.\n    For num = \"2020\" the output should be 2.\n    \"\"\"", "answer": "    primes = ('2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D')\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(0, len(num)):\n        if num[i] in primes:\n            total += 1\n    return total", "result": "Here\u2019s a Python function to solve the problem according to the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef hex_key(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Receives a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal\n    digits that are primes.\n    \n    Prime digits in hex are: 2, 3, 5, 7, B (11 in decimal), D (13 in decimal).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the set of prime digits in hexadecimal\n    prime_digits = {'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'}\n    \n    # Count the occurrences of these prime digits in the input string\n    count = sum(1 for char in num if char in prime_digits)\n    \n    return count\n\n# Examples:\nprint(hex_key(\"AB\"))  # Output: 1\nprint(hex_key(\"1077E\"))  # Output: 2\nprint(hex_key(\"ABED1A33\"))  # Output: 4\nprint(hex_key(\"123456789ABCDEF0\"))  # Output: 6\nprint(hex_key(\"2020\"))  # Output: 2\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. The set `prime_digits` contains all the hexadecimal digits that are considered prime: `'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', and 'D'`.\n2. The function iterates over each character in the input string `num`, using a generator expression `sum(1 for char in num if char in prime_digits)` that counts the characters found in the `prime_digits` set.\n3. It returns the total count.\n\nThis function is efficient and meets all the problem requirements.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [37.926738023757935], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [37.90534019470215]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1836], "completion": [338], "total": [2174]}}}

The examples provided in the docstring suggest that the function simply needs to return the sum of numbers using a well-known formula for the sum of the first \\( n \\) natural numbers: \\(\\text{Sum} = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\\). I'll implement this now.\n\n```python\ndef sum_to_n(n: int):\n    \"\"\"sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.\n    >>> sum_to_n(30)\n    465\n    >>> sum_to_n(100)\n    5050\n    >>> sum_to_n(5)\n    15\n    >>> sum_to_n(10)\n    55\n    >>> sum_to_n(1)\n    1\n    \"\"\"\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n```\n\nThis function will calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to \\( n \\) using the arithmetic series formula. If you have the means to test this, you should find that the function returns the expected results as shown in the docstring examples.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [7.235935926437378], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.214823007583618]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1631], "completion": [250], "total": [1881]}}}

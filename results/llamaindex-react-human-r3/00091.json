The string is split into sentences using a regular expression that matches `.`, `?`, or `!`.\n2. Each sentence is stripped of leading or trailing spaces.\n3. The code checks if the sentence starts with `\"I \"` (i.e., \"I\" followed by a space to distinguish words starting with \"I\").\n4. It keeps a count of such sentences.\n\n### Example:\n```python\nprint(is_bored(\"Hello world\"))  # Output: 0\nprint(is_bored(\"The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather\"))  # Output: 1\nprint(is_bored(\"I like tea. Do you? I prefer coffee!\"))  # Output: 2\n```", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [60.327674865722656], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [60.30239510536194]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1644], "completion": [395], "total": [2039]}}}

{"query": "\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\n    \"\"\"Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,\n    deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,\n    and returns the resulted list with a sorted order,\n    The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers,\n    and it may contain duplicates.\n    The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word, and you\n    should return the list sorted by that rule.\n    If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.\n    The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.\n    You may assume that all words will have the same length.\n    For example:\n    assert list_sort([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]) => [\"aa\"]\n    assert list_sort([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]) => [\"ab\", \"cd\"]\n    \"\"\"", "answer": "    lst.sort()\n    new_lst = []\n    for i in lst:\n        if len(i)%2 == 0:\n            new_lst.append(i)\n    return sorted(new_lst, key=len)", "result": "Here is the Python function, `sorted_list_sum`, that meets the requirements specified:\n\n```python\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Accepts a list of strings as a parameter,\n    deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,\n    and returns the resultant list with a sorted order.\n\n    The list is sorted in ascending order by the length of each word,\n    and alphabetically if two words have the same length.\n\n    Parameters:\n        lst (list of str): List of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of str: Sorted and filtered list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Filter out strings with odd lengths\n    even_length_words = [word for word in lst if len(word) % 2 == 0]\n    \n    # Sort the list by length, and then alphabetically for words of the same length\n    return sorted(even_length_words, key=lambda word: (len(word), word))\n\n# Test examples\nassert sorted_list_sum([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]) == [\"aa\"]\nassert sorted_list_sum([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]) == [\"ab\", \"cd\"]\nassert sorted_list_sum([\"abcd\", \"xy\", \"mnop\", \"kl\"]) == [\"kl\", \"xy\", \"abcd\", \"mnop\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Filter words with even lengths**:\n   The list comprehension `[word for word in lst if len(word) % 2 == 0]` filters out all strings with odd lengths.\n\n2. **Sorting logic**:\n   - The `sorted()` function is used to sort the list.\n   - A custom `key` is provided via a lambda function: `key=lambda word: (len(word), word)`.\n   - The list is first sorted by the length of each string (`len(word)`), and for strings with the same length, it is sorted alphabetically (`word`).\n\n3. **Usage and testing**:\n   The example test cases validate the correctness of the function. If the assertions pass, the function meets the requirements.\n\nFeel free to test this function with your own examples!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [7.495106935501099], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.475430011749268]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1724], "completion": [428], "total": [2152]}}}

The result is joined back into a single string, preserving the spaces and word order.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [7.921911001205444], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.89317512512207]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1667], "completion": [468], "total": [2135]}}}

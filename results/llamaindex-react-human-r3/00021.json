The list comprehension iterates over the input numbers and applies this linear transformation. \n\nLet me know if you want me to run a test or clarify!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [11.203796148300171], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [11.184690952301025]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1659], "completion": [245], "total": [1904]}}}

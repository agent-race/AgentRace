I need to assist the user in writing the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` which checks whether a given number `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers.\n\nThe function should evaluate:\n\n1. Whether it's possible to express `n` as the sum of four positive even numbers.\n2. Return `True` if possible, otherwise `False`.\n\nTo do this, consider:\n\n- Positive even numbers are multiples of 2.\n- The smallest sum of four positive even numbers would be 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.\n- So any number less than 8 cannot be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers.\n\nNow, let's proceed to write the function.\n\n```python\ndef is_equal_to_sum_even(n):\n    \"\"\"Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.\"\"\"\n    # The smallest sum of four positive even numbers (2, 2, 2, 2) is 8.\n    # Therefore, if n is smaller than 8, it's impossible to have such a sum.\n    if n < 8:\n        return False\n    # Since we're only considering positive even numbers, n must be even.\n    return n % 2 == 0\n\n# Examples\nprint(is_equal_to_sum_even(4)) # False\nprint(is_equal_to_sum_even(6)) # False\nprint(is_equal_to_sum_even(8)) # True\n```\n\nThis function checks whether `n` is at least 8 and whether `n` is even. If both conditions are satisfied, then `n` can theoretically be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [9.180730104446411], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [9.159674882888794]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1614], "completion": [362], "total": [1976]}}}

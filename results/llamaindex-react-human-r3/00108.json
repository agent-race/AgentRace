It accounts for both positive and negative integers.\n   - When the number is negative, we treat the first digit as negative.\n   - Otherwise, it calculates the regular sum of digits.\n\n2. **Filtering Logic**: We iterate over the array and use the helper function to filter the numbers whose sum of digits is greater than 0. \n\n3. **Result Calculation**: By summing up `1` for each valid number, we get the count of numbers whose signed digit sum is greater than 0.\n\nThis implementation handles both empty arrays and arrays with positive/negative integers properly.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [95.52795505523682], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [95.50868701934814]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1661], "completion": [457], "total": [2118]}}}

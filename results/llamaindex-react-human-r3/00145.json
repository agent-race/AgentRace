The function should also maintain the original order of elements with the same digit sum. I will write the implementation for this function.\n\nHere's how you could implement the `order_by_points` function:\n\n```python\ndef order_by_points(nums):\n    def digit_sum(n):\n        return sum(int(d) for d in str(abs(n)))\n\n    return sorted(nums, key=lambda x: (digit_sum(x), nums.index(x)))\n\n# Test the function with the provided example\nprint(order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]))  # Output should be [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]\nprint(order_by_points([]))                    # Output should be []\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. `digit_sum(n)`: This helper function calculates the sum of the digits of the absolute value of `n`.\n2. In the `sorted` function, the list is sorted using a key that is a tuple of the digit sum and the original index in the list, ensuring that items with the same digit sum retain the original order.\n\nThis implementation directly addresses the requirements set out in the problem description.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [7.692484140396118], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.6766111850738525]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1652], "completion": [255], "total": [1907]}}}

{"query": "\n\ndef car_race_collision(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.\n    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars\n    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from\n    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide\n    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.\n    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving\n    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.\n\n    This function outputs the number of such collisions.\n    \"\"\"", "answer": "    return n**2", "result": "The number of collisions will be equal to the product of the number of cars moving left to right and the number of cars moving right to left. Since collisions occur whenever a car moving left to right meets a car moving right to left, every car from one set effectively collides with every car from the other set.\n\nHere's the Python implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the number of collisions between n cars moving left to right\n    and another set of n cars moving right to left on an infinitely straight road.\n\n    Parameters:\n        n (int): The number of cars in each direction.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The total number of collisions.\n    \"\"\"\n    return n * n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- If there are `n` cars moving left to right and `n` cars moving right to left, then every car moving left to right will collide with all `n` cars moving right to left, resulting in `n * n` collisions.\n\n### Example usage:\n```python\nprint(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 25\n```", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [5.381429195404053], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.362431049346924]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1688], "completion": [235], "total": [1923]}}}

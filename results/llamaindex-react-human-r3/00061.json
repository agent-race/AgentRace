If it\u2019s not, then there are unmatched opening brackets.\n\n### Examples:\nHere\u2019s how the function behaves for the given examples:\n- `correct_bracketing(\"(\")` \u2192 `False` (unmatched opening bracket)\n- `correct_bracketing(\"()\")` \u2192 `True` (matched opening and closing brackets)\n- `correct_bracketing(\"(()())\")` \u2192 `True` (all brackets are matched correctly)\n- `correct_bracketing(\")(()\")` \u2192 `False` (closing bracket appears before an opening bracket)\n\nLet me know if you need further clarification!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [43.806692123413086], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [43.79059410095215]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1626], "completion": [390], "total": [2016]}}}

The task is to compute the sum and product of a list of integers, with specific behaviors for empty lists. I need to implement the function that accomplishes this.\n\nHere's the implementation for the `sum_product` function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.\n    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.\n    >>> sum_product([])\n    (0, 1)\n    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])\n    (10, 24)\n    \"\"\"\n    total_sum = sum(numbers)\n    total_product = 1\n    for number in numbers:\n        total_product *= number\n    return (total_sum, total_product)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(sum_product([]))  # Output: (0, 1)\nprint(sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: (10, 24)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- I used the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of the list.\n- For the product, I initialized `total_product` to 1 (as per the requirement for empty lists) and then looped through the numbers to multiply them together.\n- The function returns the computed sum and product as a tuple.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [6.7774810791015625], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [6.7580530643463135]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1646], "completion": [318], "total": [1964]}}}

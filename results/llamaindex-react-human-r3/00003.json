The `balance` variable is initialized to `0` to represent the starting bank balance.\n2. Iterate through the list `operations`, adding or subtracting each operation value to/from the `balance`.\n3. If at any step `balance` goes below `0`, the function returns `True`.\n4. If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, the function returns `False`.\n\nYou can test it with the provided docstring examples or other custom test cases.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [5.028074026107788], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.007297992706299]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1655], "completion": [266], "total": [1921]}}}

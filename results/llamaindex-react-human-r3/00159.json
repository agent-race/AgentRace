This ensures you never eat more than the available carrots but aim to eat as many as needed.\n2. **Update the total eaten carrots**: Add the number of actually eaten carrots to the initial `number`.\n3. **Calculate the remaining carrots**: Subtract the eaten carrots from the `remaining` stock.\n4. **Return the result**: An array containing the total carrots eaten and the remaining stock.\n\n### Examples:\nUsing the provided function:\n```python\nprint(eat(5, 6, 10))  # Output: [11, 4]\nprint(eat(4, 8, 9))   # Output: [12, 1]\nprint(eat(1, 10, 10)) # Output: [11, 0]\nprint(eat(2, 11, 5))  # Output: [7, 0]\n```", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [11.56119990348816], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [11.54140591621399]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1814], "completion": [580], "total": [2394]}}}

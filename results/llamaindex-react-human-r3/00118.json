Identify which characters are vowels (`AEIOUaeiou`) and consonants.\n2. Traverse the word from the second to the last character (from right to left).\n3. Check if the current character is a vowel and if it's surrounded by consonants.\n4. Return the vowel if the condition is met.\n5. If no such vowel exists, return an empty string.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```python\nprint(get_closest_vowel(\"yogurt\"))  # Output: \"u\"\nprint(get_closest_vowel(\"FULL\"))    # Output: \"U\"\nprint(get_closest_vowel(\"quick\"))   # Output: \"\"\nprint(get_closest_vowel(\"ab\"))      # Output: \"\"\n```", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [21.33840584754944], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [21.31738805770874]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1686], "completion": [396], "total": [2082]}}}

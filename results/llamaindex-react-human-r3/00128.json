Multiply all these signs together.\n3. Multiply the sum of magnitudes by the product of signs to compute the final result.\n\nHere's how the function can be implemented:\n\n```python\ndef prod_signs(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given an array arr of integers and you need to return\n    sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs\n    of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1 or 0.\n    Note: return None for empty arr.\n\n    Example:\n    >>> prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]) == -9\n    >>> prod_signs([0, 1]) == 0\n    >>> prod_signs([]) == None\n    \"\"\"\n    # Return None for empty array\n    if not arr:\n        return None\n\n    # Compute the sum of magnitudes\n    magnitude_sum = sum(abs(x) for x in arr)\n\n    # Compute the product of signs\n    sign_product = 1\n    for num in arr:\n        if num == 0: # If the number is 0, the product becomes 0\n            sign_product = 0\n            break\n        sign_product *= (1 if num > 0 else -1)\n\n    # Multiply the sum of magnitudes by the product of signs\n    return magnitude_sum * sign_product\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Edge Case 1 (`[]`):** If the list is empty, return `None`.\n- **Sum of Magnitudes:** Use `sum(abs(x) for x in arr)` to calculate the sum of the absolute values of numbers in the array.\n- **Product of Signs:** Loop through the array and multiply the signs of the numbers. If any number is 0, the product immediately becomes 0.\n- **Final Result:** Multiply the sum of magnitudes by the product of signs.\n\n### Example Walkthrough:\n1. `prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4])`:\n   - Magnitude Sum: `|1| + |2| + |2| + |4| = 9`\n   - Product of Signs: `1 * 1 * 1 * -1 = -1`\n   - Result: `9 * -1 = -9`\n\n2. `prod_signs([0, 1])`:\n   - Magnitude Sum: `|0| + |1| = 1`\n   - Product of Signs: `0 (since one of the numbers is 0)`\n   - Result: `1 * 0 = 0`\n\n3. `prod_signs([])`:\n   - Result: `None` (empty array).\n\nThis implementation is efficient and covers all edge cases.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [78.95620203018188], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [78.93131685256958]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1659], "completion": [653], "total": [2312]}}}

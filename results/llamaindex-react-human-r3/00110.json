Count the odd numbers in `lst1`, as those are the ones that need to be replaced.\n2. Count the even numbers in `lst2`, as those are potential replacements for the odd numbers in `lst1`.\n3. If the count of even numbers in `lst2` is greater than or equal to the count of odd numbers in `lst1`, then replacing is possible, so return `\"YES\"`. Otherwise, return `\"NO\"`.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```python\nprint(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: \"YES\"\nprint(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]))  # Output: \"NO\"\n```", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [9.70592713356018], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [9.678940057754517]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1734], "completion": [403], "total": [2137]}}}

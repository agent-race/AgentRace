For example:\n\n```python\nprint(make_a_pile(3))  # Output: [3, 5, 7]\nprint(make_a_pile(4))  # Output: [4, 6, 8, 10]\n```", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [6.324862957000732], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [6.304796934127808]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1669], "completion": [306], "total": [1975]}}}

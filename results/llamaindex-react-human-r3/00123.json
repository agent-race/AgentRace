{"query": "\ndef get_odd_collatz(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.\n\n    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined\n    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the \n    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of \n    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous\n    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n\n    Note: \n        1.

A `set` is used to store the odd numbers encountered in the sequence to ensure uniqueness.\n2. A `while` loop continues iterating until the value of `n` reaches `1`.\n3. Inside the loop:\n   - If `n` is odd, it is added to the `set`.\n   - If `n` is even, it is divided by 2.\n   - If `n` is odd, it is updated to `3 * n + 1`.\n4. After the loop, `1` is added to the set because the sequence always ends with `1`.\n5. The set is converted to a sorted list and returned.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [44.88987898826599], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [44.873393058776855]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1768], "completion": [393], "total": [2161]}}}

If they are different, we append '1' to the result; otherwise, '0'.\n- Finally, we concatenate these characters into the resultant string. \n\nThis function will now perform the desired XOR operation on the input strings.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [11.959882974624634], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [11.944627046585083]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1612], "completion": [291], "total": [1903]}}}

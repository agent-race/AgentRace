The base cases are specified, and the pattern is provided.\n\nTo compute this efficiently, I can use dynamic programming by storing already computed values to avoid redundant calculations. This can be achieved by using a list to store the computed values and building up from the base cases.\n\nHere's how to implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef fibfib(n: int) -> int:\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 2:\n        return 1\n    \n    fibfib_sequence = [0, 0, 1]\n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        next_value = fibfib_sequence[i - 1] + fibfib_sequence[i - 2] + fibfib_sequence[i - 3]\n        fibfib_sequence.append(next_value)\n    \n    return fibfib_sequence[n]\n\n# Example usages:\nprint(fibfib(1))  # Output: 0\nprint(fibfib(5))  # Output: 4\nprint(fibfib(8))  # Output: 24\n```\n\nNow let's test it to ensure it's functioning correctly.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [26.570498943328857], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [26.549055099487305]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1686], "completion": [280], "total": [1966]}}}

The key points are:\n1. Incrementing the balance for an opening bracket (`<`).\n2. Decrementing the balance for a closing bracket (`>`).\n3. Ensuring the balance never goes negative during iteration.\n4. Verifying that the balance ends at 0 to confirm all brackets are matched. \n\nYou can test this implementation with the given examples to verify its correctness.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [5.985382795333862], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.966516971588135]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1629], "completion": [317], "total": [1946]}}}

Here are some comprehensive tips based on the aggregated information:\n\n### Regular Cleaning\n1. **Dusting**: Use a soft, dry cloth or microfiber cloth to dust the table regularly. This prevents dust build-up that can scratch the surface.\n2. **Wiping**: For thorough cleaning, use a slightly damp cloth with mild soap or a wood cleaner, then dry immediately to prevent water damage. Avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive materials that can harm the wood.\n\n### Protection\n3. **Use Coasters and Placements**: Protect the table from water marks, heat damage, and scratches by using coasters, placemats, or trivets when placing items on the table.\n4. **Avoid Direct Sunlight**: Sunlight can fade and warp the wood over time. Use curtains or UV-filtering films to shield the table from direct exposure.\n5. **Heat and Moisture**: Avoid placing hot dishes or cups directly on the table without protection. Spills should be blotted immediately to avoid water damage.\n\n### Maintenance\n6. **Polishing and Conditioning**: Regularly apply furniture wax or polish to maintain shine and protect the finish.

Reapply the finish as necessary to protect the wood.\n\n### Repair and Care\n8. **Handling Scratches and Stains**: Minor scratches can be treated with wood markers or natural oils like walnuts. For water stains, gently rub with baking soda mixed with toothpaste or use a specialized wood cleaner.\n9. **Professional Repair**: Seek professional help for deeper scratches or structural damage to ensure proper restoration.\n\n### Long-Term Tips\n10. **Environment**: Maintain stable humidity levels with humidifiers or dehumidifiers to prevent the wood from swelling or contracting due to environmental changes.\n11. **Tablecloth Use**: Consider using a tablecloth or runner during activities that may damage the surface.\n\n### Specific Wood Types\n- **Oak and Pine**: Sensitive to scratches; avoid heavy items and use scratch-resistant finishes.\n- **Mahogany and Walnut**: Sensitive to moisture; keep away from humid environments and regularly condition the wood.\n\nBy following these care tips, your wooden table will stay in excellent condition for a long time, preserving its natural beauty and functionality.

Here's a synthesized and concise guide for you:\n\n---\n\n### **How to Make Frosting with Crisco (Vegetable Shortening):**\n\n#### **Ingredients:**\n- **1 cup Crisco shortening** (vegetable shortening)\n- **2-4 cups powdered sugar** (adjust for sweetness/consistency)\n- **1/2 teaspoon salt** (optional, to balance sweetness)\n- **1 teaspoon vanilla extract** (or other flavoring)\n- **2-4 tablespoons milk or heavy cream** (adjust for desired consistency)\n\n#### **Instructions:**\n1. **Soften the Crisco**: Allow Crisco to come to room temperature for ease of mixing.\n  \n2. **Cream the Crisco**: In a mixing bowl, beat the Crisco with an electric mixer for 2-3 minutes until smooth and fluffy.\n  \n3. **Add Powdered Sugar Gradually**: Mix in powdered sugar one cup at a time, on low speed, to avoid mess. Continue until fully incorporated.\n\n4. **Add Flavor and Salt**: Mix in the vanilla extract and a pinch of salt to enhance flavor.\n\n5. **Adjust Consistency**: Gradually add milk or heavy cream (1 tablespoon at a time) and beat until the frosting is smooth, creamy, and spreadable. Use less milk for piping decorations; more milk for a creamier texture.\n\n6. **Beat Until Smooth**: Beat the entire mixture at medium-high speed for about 2-4 minutes to achieve a fluffy and airy frosting.\n\n#### **Optional Customizations:**\n- Add **food coloring** (a few drops at a time) for varied shades.\n- For **chocolate frosting**, add 1/2 cup cocoa powder.\n- Replace vanilla with other extracts, such as almond, coconut, or peppermint, for unique flavors.\n\n#### **Tips:**\n- For pure white frosting, skip unsalted butter and use clear vanilla extract.\n- Crisco frosting is heat-stable, making it great for decorating in warm weather.\n- Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator. Let it come to room temperature and re-whip before using.\n\n---\n\nThis frosting is ideal for cakes, cupcakes, and piping decorations. Try it and enjoy your deliciously creamy frosting made with Crisco!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 33, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 33, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 33, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 33, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 33, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 33, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 33, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 33, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 33, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 1801, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 2410, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2245, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 1948, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 1845, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 1980, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2353, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 2011, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2168}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 0}, "total_time": [55.08688807487488], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [4.596941947937012, 8.04486608505249], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.5393099784851074, 4.235014915466309, 4.349205017089844], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [15.497915983200073, 15.51042103767395, 17.021865129470825], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [21.69532585144043, 30.9888699054718, 42.4120409488678]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [227, 5308], "completion": [233, 485], "total": [460, 5793]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [31, 31, 31], "completion": [424, 551, 519], "total": [455, 582, 550]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [21, 21, 21], "completion": [494, 464, 510], "total": [515, 485, 531]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [53, 53, 53], "completion": [544, 476, 495], "total": [597, 529, 548]}}}

Remove old flashing and install new flashing, sealing with roofing cement.\n   - **Small Holes or Cracks:** Apply roofing cement or a waterproof sealant.\n\n2. **Check Roof Valleys & Vents:**\n   - Clean out debris from valleys to prevent water pooling.\n   - Replace or seal damaged vent boots or other roof penetrations.\n\n3. **Gutters:**\n   - Ensure gutters and downspouts are clean to prevent water backup.\n\n4. **Temporary Fix (If Immediate Repair Isn't Possible):**\n   - Secure a tarp over the leak as a temporary fix.\n\n### Post-Repair Inspect and Test\n- **Test for leaks:** Simulate rain with a hose to ensure that repairs hold.\n- **Inspect the attic and repaired areas** for signs of water intrusion.\n\n### When to Call a Professional\n- If the damage is extensive or the roof is steep/dangerous.\n- If you are unsure about the repair or suspect structural issues.\n\n### Prevent Future Leaks\n- Conduct regular roof inspections (spring and fall).\n- Keep gutters clean and functional.\n- Trim overhanging branches to avoid debris accumulation.\n\nBy following these steps, you can address a leaking roof effectively and possibly prevent future issues. Remember, safety is paramount, and hiring a professional may be necessary if you're uncomfortable with the task.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 29, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 29, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 29, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 29, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 29, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 29, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 29, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 29, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 29, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2555, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2746, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2982, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 2938, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 3064, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 3116, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 2186, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2448, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2253}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 0}, "total_time": [60.76386618614197], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [34.487205028533936, 9.002153158187866], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.415388822555542, 5.15173602104187, 5.244560956954956], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.51741099357605, 7.6380650997161865, 8.094983100891113], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [10.051452875137329, 17.115165948867798, 17.216166019439697]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [228, 6441], "completion": [233, 490], "total": [461, 6931]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [31, 31, 31], "completion": [588, 675, 650], "total": [619, 706, 681]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [53, 53, 53], "completion": [634, 686, 695], "total": [687, 739, 748]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [21, 21, 21], "completion": [526, 583, 540], "total": [547, 604, 561]}}}

{"query": "instruction: Hi, I'd like to learn how to play racquetball. Can you explain the game to me?", "answer": "Sure! Racquetball is a sport that is played with four walls, a racquet, and a ball. The object of the game is to hit the ball with your racquet and make it bounce off of the walls without your opponent hitting it back. You can only hit the ball once before your opponent has to hit it back. The first person to reach 11 points wins the game.", "result": "Here's a comprehensive guide to help you learn how to play racquetball:\n\n### 1. Objective of the Game\n- **Objective**: The goal is to hit the ball in such a way that your opponent cannot return it before it bounces twice on the floor.\n\n### 2. Equipment Needed\n- **Racquetball racquet**: Light with a short handle and large head, often made of graphite or aluminum.\n- **Racquetball**: A small, bouncy rubber ball, usually with a blue or green dot for beginners.\n- **Protective eyewear**: Safety goggles are essential to protect your eyes.\n- **Athletic shoes**: Court shoes with good grip are ideal.\n\n### 3. Court Layout\n- The racquetball court is 20 feet wide by 40 feet long with a 20-foot high ceiling.\n- **Lines**:\n  - **Short line**: Divides the court into front and back sections.\n  - **Service line**: Located in front of the short line.\n  - **Service box**: The area where the server stands to serve.\n\n### 4. Basic Rules and Play\n- **Serving**:\n  - Stand in the service box and bounce the ball once, then hit it against the front wall.\n  - The ball must land past the short line without hitting the back wall directly.\n  - If it hits the side wall or ceiling before bouncing, it's a fault (two faults result in loss of serve).\n- **Rallies**:\n  - Players hit the ball against the front wall, alternating turns, ensuring it bounces only once on the floor.\n  - The ball can hit side or back walls after hitting the front wall, but must reach the front before bouncing twice.\n\n### 5. Scoring\n- Only the server can score points.\n- Games are typically played to 15 points (must win by at least two points).\n- Matches are usually best of 3 or 5 games.\n\n### 6. Techniques and Shots\n- **Forehand and Backhand**: Basic shots using the front edge or back edge of the racquet.\n- **Serve**: Practice hitting the ball smoothly and consistently.\n- **Lob Shot**: High, slow shot forcing the opponent to the back court.\n- **Kill Shot**: A fast, low shot that makes quick bounces.\n\n### 7. Strategy and Movement\n- Control the center of the court to position yourself well.\n- Force your opponent to move by varying your shots.\n- Anticipate the ball's movement and react quickly.\n\n### 8. Safety and Etiquette\n- **Wear eye protection** at all times.\n- Avoid blocking your opponent\u2014always give them space (call hinder if this happens).\n- Respect your opponent and the rules; fair play is essential.\n\n### 9. Practice Tips\n- Start with slow rallies to get comfortable.\n- Focus on consistency over power in your shots.\n- Play with various opponents to improve your game.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can enjoy playing racquetball while developing your skills progressively.

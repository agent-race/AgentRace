Multi-level cages with ramps and platforms are ideal for added stimulation.\n2. **Materials**: Wire cages with appropriate bar spacing (**\u00bd inch or less**) prevent escapes and injuries. Aquariums are viable, but ventilation may be less optimal.\n3. **Bedding**: Use absorbent and safe bedding like **paper-based bedding, aspen shavings, fleece liners**, or towels (clean these regularly). Avoid cedar or pine as they are toxic to rats.\n4. **Accessories**: Provide hiding spots (tunnels, huts, plants, boxes), toys (chew toys, ropes, and ladders), food dishes, and water bottles. Rats enjoy climbing structures and exercise balls (supervised use only).\n5. **Placement**: Place the cage in a room with stable temperatures (**65-75\u00b0F**) and moderate humidity (around **50-60%**). Ensure the area is quiet and draft-free.\n\n---\n\n### **Feeding Your Rat**\n1. **Staple Diet**: High-quality **rat pellets or lab blocks** specifically formulated for rats.\n2. **Fresh Foods**: Supplement with fresh vegetables (spinach, kale, carrots) and fruits (apples, blueberries). Feed fruit in moderation due to sugar content.\n3. **Proteins**: Include small amounts of cooked chicken, turkey, or eggs for protein.\n4. **Grains/Seeds**: Small amounts of oatmeal, brown rice, or birdseed serve as healthy extras.\n5. **Water**: Provide fresh, clean water daily using a water bottle attached to the cage to prevent contamination.\n6. **Avoid Toxic Foods**: Never feed rats chocolate, caffeine, onions, garlic, avocado, raw beans, or citrus (especially for males). Limit sugary or salty foods.\n\n---\n\n### **General Care**\n1. **Socialization**: Rats are highly social animals and thrive in pairs or small groups. Keep same-sex rats together unless neutered/spayed.\n2. **Enrichment**: Rotate toys to prevent boredom. Allow at least **1 hour of supervised playtime** daily in a safe, rat-proofed area.\n3. **Cleaning**: Spot-clean bedding daily and do a full cage cleaning weekly using mild soap or vinegar.\n4. **Health Checks**: Monitor for warning signs like **sneezing, lethargy, lumps**, or difficulty breathing, as rats are prone to respiratory infections and tumors.\n5. **Handling**: Handle them gently and avoid picking them up by their tail. Build trust through positive reinforcement using treats.\n\n---\n\n### **Veterinary and Long-Term Care**\n1. **Vet Visits**: Schedule regular check-ups with an **exotic animal vet** experienced in treating rats.\n2. **Spaying/Neutering**: Reduces hormonal issues in males and decreases the risk of mammary tumors in females.\n3. **Lifespan**: Rats typically live **2-3 years**, so be prepared to provide dedicated care throughout their short but fulfilling lives.\n\nBy adhering to these recommendations, you\u2019ll create a safe, healthy, and enriching environment for your pet rat.

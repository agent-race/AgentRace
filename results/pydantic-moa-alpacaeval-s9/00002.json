    "query": "instruction: Hi, my sister and her girlfriends want me to play kickball with them. Can you explain how the game is played, so they don't take advantage of me?",
    "answer": "Kickball is a game similar to baseball, but with a large rubber ball instead of a bat and a ball. The game is usually played with two teams of six players each. Each team has three bases and a home plate. The players on the kicking team line up at home plate and take turns kicking the ball. The object of the game is to score runs by running around all three bases and back to home plate without being tagged out by the defense. The team with the most runs at the end of the game is the winner.",
    "result": "Kickball is a fun team game that combines elements of soccer and baseball. It\u2019s played on a diamond-shaped field with bases similar to those in baseball. Here's a comprehensive explanation of how to play kickball, including the rules and strategies:\n\n### Basic Setup:\n- **Teams:** Two teams, typically with 9-11 players each.\n- **Field:** A diamond-shaped field with four bases: home plate, first base, second base, and third base.\n- **Equipment:** A large rubber ball is used in place of a baseball.\n\n### Gameplay Overview:\n1. **Pitching:**\n   - The ball is rolled underhand by the pitcher from the defensive team across home plate towards the kicker.\n\n2. **Kicking:**\n   - The offensive team\u2019s kicker stands at home plate and kicks the ball once it\u2019s rolled towards them.\n\n3. **Running:**\n   - After kicking the ball, the kicker runs to first base and can continue rounding the bases if the play allows.\n\n4. **Fielding:**\n   - The defensive team attempts to catch the ball or field it to make plays that prevent the runners from advancing or to get them out.\n\n### Key Rules:\n- **Bases:** Players run the bases in sequence starting with first base, then second, third, and finally back to home plate to score a run.\n- **Outs:** Are achieved if:\n  - A fielding player catches a kicked ball before it hits the ground.\n  - A runner is tagged with the ball while off base, or if the ball is thrown to a base before the runner gets there (force-out).\n  - A player has three strikes when kicking.\n- **Innings:** Games are played over several innings, typically between 5 to 7.\n\n### Scoring:\n- A run is tallied when a player successfully rounds all the bases and returns to home plate.\n\n### Strategies:\n#### For Kickers:\n- **Placement Kicking:** Kicking the ball into gaps between defenders to ensure it\u2019s difficult to field.\n- **Bunting:** A softer kick intended to advance runners already on base.\n- **Timing and Speed:** Fast play and precise kicking can successfully advance runners.\n\n#### For Fielders:\n- **Positioning:** Effective placement of fielders to cover likely kicking areas.\n- **Communication:** Calling out plays and coordinating fielding efforts.\n- **Fast Throws:** Getting the ball quickly to the bases to stop runners.\n\n### Variations and Extras:\n- **No Headshots:** Rules in some leagues may prevent throwing the ball at runners above the shoulders.\n- **Mercy Rule:** Games may be ended if one team leads by a significant number of runs.\n- **Ghost Runners:** If you are short on players, imaginary runners can be used to simulate missing players.\n\nWhether playing casually in a schoolyard or competitively in a league, kickball offers fun and exercise for players of all ages and skill levels. Familiarize yourself with the basic rules and positioning strategies, and you\u2019ll be well-prepared to join in the fun and avoid your sister and her friends taking advantage of you on the field!",

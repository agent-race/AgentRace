{"query": "instruction: Why is kobe beef so damn expensive?", "answer": "Kobe beef is expensive because it is a high-quality, rare breed of beef from the Japanese Wagyu cattle. The cattle are raised in a special way that produces a unique flavor and texture, making it a much sought-after delicacy. Additionally, the process of raising and aging the beef is very labor intensive, and the beef is only available in limited supply.", "result": "The high cost of Kobe beef can be summarized into several distinct factors that contribute to its premium price:\n\n1. **Breed and Genetics**:\n   - Kobe beef comes exclusively from the Tajima strain of Japanese Black cattle, a breed renowned for its exceptional marbling and tenderness. The genetic traits of these cattle allow for higher levels of intramuscular fat, setting the meat apart from other beef.\n\n2. **Geographical Restrictions**:\n   - Authentic Kobe beef can only be produced in the Hyogo prefecture of Japan, with strict regulations ensuring it is raised, slaughtered, and prepared in this region. This constraint significantly limits the supply.\n\n3. **Labor-Intensive Rearing and Care**:\n   - Kobe cattle are raised with meticulous care. Farmers use specialized diets, sometimes incorporating beer, and maintain stress-free environments. Often, massages are employed to ensure better fat distribution and muscle relaxation, further enhancing the quality.\n\n4. **Exceptional Marbling**:\n   - Kobe beef is celebrated for its intense marbling (intramuscular fat), which gives the meat its buttery texture and rich flavor. The marbling is rated with a high Beef Marbling Score (BMS), typically between 10\u201312 (the highest grades).\n   \n5. **Stringent Certification**:\n   - Only beef meeting rigorous criteria\u2014including breed purity, marbling quality, and other advanced grading metrics\u2014receives the official Kobe beef certification. Institutions like the Kobe Beef Marketing & Distribution Promotion Association oversee and authenticate this process.\n\n6. **Limited Supply and High Global Demand**:\n   - With only about 3,000\u20135,000 cattle certified annually for Kobe beef, supply is extremely limited. As global demand for this luxury product grows, the scarcity creates an even steeper price point.\n\n7. **Costs of Production**:\n   - Raising Kobe cattle involves high costs, including specialized feed, extended rearing periods (up to 32 months compared to industrial cattle raised in around 18), and intensive labor. Export logistics and certification processes further drive up the price.\n\n8. **Cultural and Luxury Branding**:\n   - Kobe beef is marketed as a luxury item, often likened to fine wine or truffles. Its branding emphasizes exclusivity, excellence, and cultural heritage, which in turn supports its premium pricing strategy.\n\n9. **High-End Culinary Use**:\n   - Many top-tier chefs and restaurants feature Kobe beef as a centerpiece for luxury dining experiences. The perception and presentation of Kobe beef at these levels also significantly impact its value.\n\nIn summary, Kobe beef is an art form in meticulous farming practices, geographic exclusivity, and exceptional quality. These combined factors make it one of the most expensive and prized meats in the world.

Activate the Yeast**:\n- Mix the warm water, 1 tbsp sugar (from the 1/4 cup), and yeast in a small bowl. Allow it to sit for 5\u201310 minutes until frothy.\n\n#### **2. Mix the Dough**:\n- In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, remaining sugar, and salt.\n- Create a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture, 2 eggs, oil, and honey (if using). Stir until a shaggy dough forms.\n\n#### **3. Knead the Dough**:\n- Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 8\u201310 minutes (or 5\u20137 minutes with a stand mixer and dough hook) until smooth and elastic.\n\n#### **4. First Rise (Proofing)**:\n- Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl. Cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap and let it rise for about 1.5\u20132 hours, or until doubled in size.\n\n#### **5. Shape the Challah**:\n- Punch down the dough to release air. Divide it into 3 or 6 equal parts, depending on the braid style you choose.\n- Roll each piece into ropes (about 16 inches long) and braid. (For a round challah, form a spiral braid or coil.)\n\n#### **6. Second Rise**:\n- Place the braided loaf on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover and let it rise for another 45\u201360 minutes until puffed.\n\n#### **7. Preheat & Egg Wash**:\n- Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n- Whisk 1 egg with 1 tbsp water and brush over the loaf. Sprinkle with seeds if desired.\n\n#### **8. Bake**:\n- Bake for 25\u201330 minutes until golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped. If browning too quickly, tent with foil after 15 minutes.\n\n#### **9. Cool & Enjoy**:\n- Let the challah cool on a wire rack for at least 20 minutes before slicing.\n\n---\n\n### **Tips & Variations**:\n1. **Enriched Flavor**: Add raisins, chocolate chips, or dried cranberries to the dough.\n2. **Soft Crust**: Cover your challah lightly with a towel while it cools to retain moisture.\n3. **Storage**: Keep leftovers in an airtight wrap for 2\u20133 days or freeze for a month.\n4. **Make-Ahead Dough**: After the first rise, refrigerate the dough overnight for a slower fermentation\u2014just bring it to room temperature before shaping and baking.\n\n---\n\nThis recipe integrates traditions while allowing room for personal touches.

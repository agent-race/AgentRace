Here's a synthesized recipe based on the inputs:\n\n---\n\n### Canjeero (Somali Flatbread) Recipe  \n\n#### **Ingredients:**  \n- 2 cups of teff flour (or a mix of teff and all-purpose flour for accessibility)  \n- 1/2 cup of fine cornmeal or rice flour (optional, for texture)  \n- 2 cups of warm water (adjust as needed for consistency)  \n- 1 tsp active dry yeast (or baking powder if making a quicker version)  \n- 1/2 tsp sugar (to activate yeast)  \n- 1/2 tsp salt  \n- 1 tbsp plain yogurt or 1/2 tsp vinegar (optional, for tanginess)  \n\n---\n\n#### **Instructions:**  \n\n1. **Prepare the Batter:**  \n   - In a mixing bowl, combine the teff flour, optional cornmeal, sugar, yeast, and salt.  \n   - Gradually add warm water while stirring to create a smooth batter. It should be thin (like pancake batter).  \n   - For tanginess, stir in plain yogurt or vinegar.  \n   - Cover the bowl with a cloth and let it ferment for **6-12 hours** (minimum) or overnight. This fermentation gives Canjeero its characteristic slightly sour flavor.  \n\n2. **Cook the Canjeero:**  \n   - Preheat a non-stick skillet over medium heat (use a traditional griddle if available).  \n   - Stir the bubbly fermented batter. Add water if it's too thick.  \n   - Pour a ladleful of batter into the skillet, swirling gently to spread into a circular shape.  \n   - Cover and cook for about **2-3 minutes** until bubbles form, and the surface sets. (Do not flip; Canjeero is cooked on one side only.)  \n\n3. **Repeat the Process:**  \n   - Remove the cooked Canjeero using a spatula. Repeat with the remaining batter.  \n\n4. **Serving Suggestions:**  \n   - Serve warm with Somali stews (maraq), saut\u00e9ed liver (beer), honey, or Somali ghee (subag). You can also enjoy it as a savory base in meals or a sweet breakfast treat.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Tips for Success:**  \n- For authentic results, use **sorghum flour** if teff is unavailable but you want Somali flavor.  \n- Control batter thickness: Thinner batter = a lighter, spongier result.  \n- Canjeero can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days, but it\u2019s best consumed fresh.  \n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need further help or variations for this dish!

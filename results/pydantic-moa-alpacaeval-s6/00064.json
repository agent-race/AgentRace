Here's a combined, versatile version for you to choose from, integrating all the helpful details:\n\n---\n\n### **Israeli Cheese Bourekas Recipe**\n\n#### **Ingredients:**\n\n**For the Dough:**\n- **Option 1**: 1 package of puff pastry (store-bought, about 17 oz / 500g)\n- **Option 2**: Homemade dough:\n    - 2 cups all-purpose flour\n    - 1/2 cup warm water\n    - 1/4 tsp salt\n    - 1/4 tsp sugar\n    - 1/2 tbsp vegetable oil or olive oil\n    - 1 tbsp active dry yeast (optional, for fluffiness)\n\n**For the Filling:**\n- 1 cup crumbled feta cheese\n- 1 cup ricotta or Bulgarian white cheese\n- 1/2 cup grated mozzarella cheese (optional for melty texture)\n- 1 egg\n- 1 tbsp chopped parsley or dill (optional)\n- Black pepper to taste\n- Salt to taste (optional, depending on cheese saltiness)\n\n**For Topping:**\n- 1 egg (beaten for egg wash)\n- Sesame or nigella seeds (optional)\n\n---\n\n#### **Instructions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Dough (if using homemade):**\n   - Combine the flour, salt, sugar, yeast (if using), water, and vegetable oil. Mix until dough forms.\n   - Knead for 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.\n   - Cover and allow to rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour (until it doubles in size).\n\n2. **Prepare the Filling:**\n   - In a bowl, mix feta, ricotta, mozzarella (if using), egg, parsley/dill, black pepper, and optional salt.\n   - Adjust seasoning to taste.\n\n3. **Shape the Bourekas:**\n   - Roll out the puff pastry (or dough) on a floured surface.\n   - Cut into 3-4 inch squares or circles.\n   - Place 1-2 tbsp of the filling in the center of each piece.\n   - Fold into desired shapes: triangles, rectangles, or half-moons. Press edges to seal (use a fork for decoration and extra sealing).\n\n4. **Bake:**\n   - Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n   - Place shaped bourekas on a parchment-lined baking sheet.\n   - Brush with beaten egg and sprinkle sesame/nigella seeds if desired.\n   - Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown and puffed.\n\n5. **Serve:**\n   - Serve warm or at room temperature. Pair with an Israeli salad, tahini dip, or pickles for a complete experience.\n\n---\n\n### **Tips:**\n- For flaky results, double-layer puff pastry or brush phyllo sheets with butter/oil before layering.\n- If freezing: Assemble unbaked bourekas, freeze on a tray, then transfer to a freezer-safe bag. Bake frozen, adding 5-10 minutes extra.\n- Variations: Add spinach, mashed potato, or mushrooms to the filling for a twist.\n\nEnjoy your homemade bourekas!

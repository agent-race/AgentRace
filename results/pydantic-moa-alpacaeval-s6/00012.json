Prepare the Batter:**\n1. In a large bowl, combine the flour(s), cornmeal (if using), yeast, sugar, and salt.\n2. Gradually add lukewarm water and/or milk, stirring continuously until you get a smooth, thin pancake-like batter.\n3. **Fermentation:** Cover the bowl with a clean cloth and let the batter sit in a warm place for **12\u201324 hours**. The batter should bubble and develop a mildly sour taste due to fermentation.\n\n#### **2. Cook the Canjeero:**\n1. After fermentation, stir in the baking powder (if using) for added fluffiness. If the batter is too thick, add a little water to loosen it; if too thin, add a bit of flour.\n2. Heat a non-stick skillet or traditional griddle (**mitad**) over medium heat and lightly grease it with oil.\n3. Ladle some batter onto the hot skillet and swirl it evenly to form a thin circular shape (~8\u201310 inches in diameter). \n4. Cook **uncovered** for 2\u20133 minutes until bubbles form and the edges lift slightly. Do **not flip** the Canjeero\u2014it cooks on one side only.\n5. Remove it from the skillet and repeat with remaining batter.\n\n#### **3. Serve:**\n- Stack the Canjeero and serve warm with:\n   - **Honey and ghee** (subag) for sweetness\n   - **Stews (maraq), curried meat (suqaar)**, or saut\u00e9ed vegetables for savory meals\n- It can also act as a utensil for scooping up delicious accompaniments.\n\n---\n\n### **Tips for Success**\n- **Authenticity:** Use teff or sorghum flour for a more traditional flavor.\n- **Texture:** Adjust the batter consistency based on preference; thinner batter gives softer Canjeero.\n- **Storage:** Store cooked Canjeero in a cloth to keep it soft. It reheats well!\n\n---\n\nEnjoy this delightful Somali flatbread for a unique addition to your guest menu!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 37, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 37, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 37, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 37, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 37, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 37, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2102, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2212, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2080, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2134, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2322, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2075}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 0, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 0}, "total_time": [53.242560148239136], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.176031827926636, 8.027899980545044], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [7.013844013214111, 7.793023109436035], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [11.174885988235474, 38.00598216056824], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [14.763153791427612, 15.571444988250732]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [219, 3888], "completion": [167, 628], "total": [386, 4516]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [32, 32], "completion": [530, 548], "total": [562, 580]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [54, 54], "completion": [510, 525], "total": [564, 579]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [22, 22], "completion": [550, 608], "total": [572, 630]}}}

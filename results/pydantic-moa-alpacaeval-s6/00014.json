{"query": "instruction: Do you know why turkeys became the official food of thanksgiving?", "answer": "The origin of turkey as a Thanksgiving staple is unclear, but it is believed that the bird was served at the first Thanksgiving feast in 1621. Turkeys are plentiful in the United States, so they became a popular choice for holiday meals. They also provide a larger quantity of meat than other birds, making them a convenient choice for large family gatherings.", "result": "The association of turkey with Thanksgiving in the United States goes back to historical and cultural factors that evolved over time, rather than a single definitive event. Here are the key reasons why turkeys became the traditional centerpiece of Thanksgiving meals:\n\n### 1. **Historical References**:\n   - **The Pilgrims and the First Thanksgiving (1621)**: Although records from the First Thanksgiving feast in 1621 between Pilgrims and Wampanoag Native Americans mention venison, waterfowl, and other hunted animals, it is not specifically documented that turkeys were part of that meal. However, wild turkeys were abundant in North America and were very likely hunted and eaten in the Pilgrim colonies.\n   - Over time, the image of turkeys became linked with the Thanksgiving story, reinforced by cultural depictions of the Pilgrims\u2019 feast.\n\n### 2. **Turkeys as a Practical Option**:\n   - **Abundance**: By the time Thanksgiving became a nationally recognized holiday, turkeys were widely available in North America. Wild turkeys were plentiful and easy to hunt, and farmers often raised domestic turkeys.\n   - **Size**: Turkeys are large birds, big enough to feed a family or a group, making them practical for a celebratory feast.\n   - **Seasonality**: The timing of Thanksgiving (late harvest season) aligns with when turkeys were traditionally slaughtered, as they were raised in the Spring and matured by the Fall.\n\n### 3. **Advocacy by Sarah Josepha Hale**:\n   - Sarah Josepha Hale, often referred to as the \"Mother of Thanksgiving,\" was a writer and magazine editor who campaigned for decades to make Thanksgiving a national holiday. In her writings, she often promoted turkey as the Thanksgiving centerpiece, further entrenching the tradition.\n\n### 4. **Abraham Lincoln's Proclamation**:\n   - After Sarah Hale's advocacy, President Abraham Lincoln declared Thanksgiving a national holiday in 1863. By then, turkey was already a common choice for the meal, and its popularity continued to grow as part of the holiday tradition.\n\n### 5. **Symbolism**:\n   - The turkey, being a uniquely North American bird, became a symbolic representation of American abundance and the Thanksgiving celebration. Its role in the Thanksgiving feast helped solidify its place in American food culture.\n\n### 6. **Popularity in Media and Culture**:\n   - Literature, paintings, and later on, movies and television shows frequently depicted Thanksgiving dinners with a turkey as the centerpiece, further ingraining the tradition in popular culture.\n\nIn essence, while the turkey\u2019s prominence at Thanksgiving arose from practical, historical, and cultural factors, its association with the holiday has been cemented through tradition and repeated imagery over centuries.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [6.007764101028442], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.9991278648376465]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [182], "completion": [564], "total": [746]}}}

Check for old stitch marks or align it with buttonholes.\n   - Make sure the button sits evenly and centered.\n\n3. **Begin Sewing the Button:**\n   - Push the needle up from the inside (wrong side) of the fabric and through one of the button's holes.\n   - Pull the thread till the knot stops it, keeping the button in place.\n   - Push the needle down through the opposite hole and repeat this for about 3-4 times for each pair of holes.\n\n4. **Create a Shank (Optional for Flat Buttons):**\n   - For thick fabrics or to allow easier buttoning, insert a toothpick or small pin on top of the button before sewing.\n   - Wrap the thread around the button's base 3-4 times to form a shank and remove the toothpick.\n\n5. **Secure the Thread:**\n   - On the inside of the fabric, make a few small loops with the needle and thread to form knots.\n   - Ensure these knots are tight for durability.\n\n6. **Finish Up:**\n   - Trim any excess thread close to the knot.\n   - Optionally, use an iron to press the area around the button for a neat finish.\n\n### **Tips and Variations:**\n- Ensure the stitches are not too tight to prevent fabric puckering.\n- For added security, use a clear nail polish over the knot.\n- If your button is decorative or thick, reinforce with extra stitches.\n- Use a sewing machine if you're not comfortable sewing by hand.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to securely attach a button to your shirt, ensuring it lasts with regular use.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 39, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 52, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 44, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 48, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 41, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 41, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2136, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2033, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2534, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2226, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 1641, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 3317}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 0}, "total_time": [62.57636904716492], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [2.207231044769287, 25.593716859817505], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.858196973800659, 3.882873058319092], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.524658203125, 34.72383117675781], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [17.88537907600403, 26.458768129348755]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [184, 3896], "completion": [175, 518], "total": [359, 4414]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [33, 33], "completion": [514, 480], "total": [547, 513]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [56, 55], "completion": [572, 742], "total": [628, 797]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [25, 23], "completion": [544, 414], "total": [569, 437]}}}

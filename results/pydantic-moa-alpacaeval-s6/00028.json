{"query": "instruction: Why is kobe beef so damn expensive?", "answer": "Kobe beef is expensive because it is a high-quality, rare breed of beef from the Japanese Wagyu cattle. The cattle are raised in a special way that produces a unique flavor and texture, making it a much sought-after delicacy. Additionally, the process of raising and aging the beef is very labor intensive, and the beef is only available in limited supply.", "result": "Kobe beef is expensive due to a combination of exclusivity, meticulous care, and premium quality. Here's an aggregated explanation combining insights from multiple agents:\n\n### Factors Behind the Cost:\n1. **Breed and Genetics**:\n   - Kobe beef comes from Tajima-gyu cattle\u2014a specific strain of Japanese Black cattle bred in Hy\u014dgo Prefecture. These cattle are genetically predisposed to produce exceptional marbling and tender meat, which significantly adds to the desirability and cost.\n\n2. **Strict Authenticity and Certification**:\n   - Not all beef marketed as \"Kobe\" is authentic; genuine Kobe beef must meet stringent standards set by the Kobe Beef Marketing & Distribution Promotion Association. These include lineage confirmation, marbling grades (BMS 6+), and regional production specifications. Only ~5,000 head of cattle qualify per year.\n\n3. **Meticulous Rearing Process**:\n   - Cattle are often pampered with personalized care, including controlled diets of high-grade grains and sometimes sake mash or beer, as well as massages to improve stress management and fat distribution. The breeding process and animal care are exceptionally labor-intensive and time-consuming.\n\n4. **Exceptional Marbling**:\n   - Kobe beef is prized for its high levels of intramuscular fat (marbling), which melts during cooking and provides its buttery texture and rich flavor. This luxurious texture and flavor demand high precision and care in cattle raising.\n\n5. **Limited Supply and High Demand**:\n   - The combination of meticulous breeding processes and strict geographical restrictions limits production. Only beef from Hy\u014dgo Prefecture qualifies as Kobe beef, which naturally restricts supply. Meanwhile, global demand remains high, driving up prices.\n\n6. **Cultural and Prestige Value**:\n   - Beyond quality, Kobe beef is marketed as a symbol of luxury and exclusivity\u2014akin to fine wine or truffles. Served in top-tier restaurants worldwide, its branding and cultural significance contribute to premium pricing.\n\n7. **Distribution and Importation Costs**:\n   - Export restrictions were eased only recently, and globally distributed Kobe beef involves tariffs, transport fees, and exclusive licensing agreements. Additional costs apply when sold in high-end restaurants.\n\n### Conclusion:\nKobe beef is a convergence of rarity, labor-intensive production, unparalleled flavor, and branding as a luxury food item. These factors all combine to justify its high price, making it one of the most expensive and sought-after meats in the world.\n\nIf you'd like, I can provide guidance on identifying authentic Kobe beef or how it compares to other types of Wagyu beef.

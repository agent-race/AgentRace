Add them to a pot with 6 cups of fresh water.\n   \n2. **Cook the Soup Base:**\n   - Bring the water and beans to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 1-1.5 hours, until the beans soften and start breaking apart.\n   - During this step, add dried tangerine peel and ginger slices for added aroma (optional).\n\n3. **Sweeten:**\n   - Add rock sugar (or white sugar). Stir until completely dissolved. Taste and adjust sweetness as needed.\n\n4. **Optional Additions:**\n   - If using sago pearls or glutinous rice balls, cook them separately according to package instructions and add them to the soup at the end.\n   - For a creamy variation, stir in a small amount of coconut milk before serving.\n\n5. **Serve:**\n   - Enjoy warm during cool weather or chilled during summer.

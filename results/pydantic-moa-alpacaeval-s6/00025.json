{"query": "instruction: What are some species of bears that are now extinct?", "answer": "Some species of bears that are now extinct include Cave bears (Ursus spelaeus), Atlas bears (Ursus crowtheri), Florida spectacled bears (Tremarctos floridanus), and Giant short-faced bears (Arctodus simus).", "result": "There have been several bear species that have gone extinct over time, often due to factors such as climate change, human activity, habitat loss, and competition. Here are some notable extinct bear species:\n\n1. **Cave Bear (*Ursus spelaeus*)**: This species lived in Europe and parts of Asia during the Pleistocene epoch and went extinct around 24,000 years ago. Cave bears were larger than the modern brown bear and are known from numerous fossils found in caves.\n\n2. **Giant Short-Faced Bear (*Arctodus simus*)**: Known as one of the largest terrestrial carnivorous mammals, it lived in North America during the Pleistocene. It went extinct around 11,000 years ago, likely due to the disappearance of large prey.\n\n3. **Atlas Bear (*Ursus arctos crowtheri*)**: This subspecies of the brown bear was native to the Atlas Mountains in North Africa and went extinct in the late 19th century due to overhunting and habitat loss.\n\n4. **Florida Cave Bear (*Tremarctos floridanus*)**: A smaller relative of the short-faced bear, it lived in North America during the Pleistocene and went extinct around 11,000 years ago.\n\n5. **Deninger\u2019s Bear (*Ursus deningeri*)**: An ancestor of modern brown and cave bears, it lived in Europe during the Pleistocene and went extinct before the last Ice Age.\n\n6. **Japanese Dwarf Bear (*Ursus arctos japonicus*)**: Found only on the island of Honshu in Japan, it likely went extinct in the 19th century due to overhunting and habitat loss.\n\n7. **California Grizzly Bear (*Ursus arctos horribilis*)**: This subspecies of grizzly bear was found only in California, USA, and went extinct in the early 20th century.\n\nThese extinct bear species highlight the importance of conservation efforts to protect the remaining bear species and their habitats from similar threats.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 66, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 65, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 54, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 60, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 54, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 47, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 1611, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2469, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2194, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 1384, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 1607, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2721}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 0}, "total_time": [37.12156796455383], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [9.846598148345947, 6.527465105056763], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.665163040161133, 6.664228916168213], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [8.858351945877075, 20.705363035202026], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [9.962101936340332, 11.587378025054932]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [180, 3392], "completion": [177, 426], "total": [357, 3818]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [36, 33], "completion": [426, 597], "total": [462, 630]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [56, 56], "completion": [517, 652], "total": [573, 708]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [24, 22], "completion": [340, 378], "total": [364, 400]}}}

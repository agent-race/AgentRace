Enjoy!", "result": "Here's a synthesis of how to make frosting with Crisco:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- **Crisco Shortening:** 1 cup\n- **Powdered Sugar:** 2 to 4 cups (adjust to desired sweetness and thickness)\n- **Milk or Heavy Cream:** 2-4 tablespoons (adjust for consistency)\n- **Vanilla Extract:** 1 teaspoon or to taste (optional)\n- **Salt:** Pinch (optional, to balance sweetness)\n- **Butter (optional):** 1/2 cup (for additional flavor and creaminess)\n\n### Instructions:\n1. **Prepare the Crisco:**\n   - Ensure your Crisco is at room temperature for easier blending. Optionally, soften the butter similarly if using.\n\n2. **Creaming the Fats:**\n   - In a large mixing bowl, beat the Crisco (and butter, if using) until smooth and fluffy, usually around 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.\n\n3. **Adding Sugar:**\n   - Gradually incorporate powdered sugar into the mixture one cup at a time to achieve the desired sweetness and thickness. Scrape the bowl often to ensure even mixing.\n\n4. **Adding Liquid and Flavorings:**\n   - Pour in the vanilla extract and a pinch of salt (optional).\n   - Gradually add milk or cream, a tablespoon at a time, until you reach your desired frosting consistency. A thicker consistency is better for piping.\n\n5. **Final Whip:**\n   - Beat the frosting on medium-high speed for about 3-5 minutes until it is light, creamy, and fully integrated.\n\n### Variations:\n- **For White Frosting:** Use only Crisco and clear vanilla extract.\n- **Flavor Additions:** Consider using almond or lemon extract, or color with food dye to adjust flavor and appearance.\n- **Chocolate Frosting:** Add cocoa powder and adjust powdered sugar to balance.\n\n### Tips:\n- Adjust consistency by adding more powdered sugar to thicken or more milk to thin out.\n- This frosting is ideal for decorating cakes and cupcakes as it holds shape well and stays firm at room temperature.\n\nEnjoy your homemade Crisco frosting! Feel free to customize with extracts or colors for unique tastes and looks.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 33, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 33, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 33, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 33, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 33, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 33, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 1801, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2308, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2070, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2335, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 1897, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2017}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 0, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 0}, "total_time": [36.32310700416565], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [8.354387998580933, 8.487141847610474], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.205923080444336, 4.22942590713501], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.928062200546265, 6.33332085609436], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [18.939621925354004, 19.40285897254944]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [176, 3636], "completion": [161, 452], "total": [337, 4088]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [31, 31], "completion": [425, 557], "total": [456, 588]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [53, 53], "completion": [484, 546], "total": [537, 599]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [21, 21], "completion": [493, 517], "total": [514, 538]}}}

Here's a simple step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Use Warm Water:** Start by rinsing your armpits with warm water. Warm water helps to open up the pores and loosens any dirt, sweat, or deodorant residues.\n\n2. **Apply a Mild Soap or Body Wash:** Use a gentle soap or body wash. Lather it up in your hands or on a washcloth.\n\n3. **Scrub Gently:** Gently scrub your armpits in a circular motion. Be sure to wash the entire area thoroughly. Avoid using very rough or abrasive materials, as the skin in this area can be sensitive.\n\n4. **Rinse Thoroughly:** Use warm water to rinse the soap completely. Make sure no residue remains, as leftover soap can lead to irritation.\n\n5. **Dry Completely:** Pat your armpits dry with a clean towel. Make sure to dry them completely to prevent moisture buildup, which can lead to odor or irritation.\n\n6. **Use Deodorant or Antiperspirant:** If desired, apply deodorant or antiperspirant to help control sweat and odor. Choose a product that's suitable for your skin type.\n\nIf you experience irritation or persistent odor despite regular cleaning, you may want to consider switching products or consulting with a dermatologist.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [3.1219000816345215], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [3.111699104309082]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [178], "completion": [274], "total": [452]}}}

Drain and rinse with cold water to prevent sticking. Toss with a little sesame oil to keep them separate.\n   \n2. **Cook the Protein (Optional):**\n   - Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wok or large pan over medium-high heat. Stir-fry your chosen protein (e.g., chicken, shrimp) until fully cooked. Set aside.\n\n3. **Prepare the Vegetables:**\n   - Heat the remaining oil in the same wok or pan. Add the garlic and onions, stir-frying until aromatic.\n   - Add the carrot, bell pepper, and cabbage, stir-frying for 2-3 minutes until tender-crisp.\n\n4. **Combine Noodles and Flavoring:**\n   - Return the protein to the pan (if you are using it) and stir well.\n   - Add the cooked noodles and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes to combine.\n   - Season with soy sauce, oyster sauce, chili paste, sugar, and masala. Ensure everything is evenly coated.\n\n5. **Optional Fried Egg or French Fries:**\n   - Push the noodle mixture to one side of the wok/pan and scramble the eggs in the empty space. Combine them into the noodles afterward for added richness.\n   - Alternatively, serve your Mine Frite topped with crispy French fries for the Mauritian street food variation.\n\n6. **Final Touches:**\n   - Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.\n   - Garnish with chopped spring onions and sesame seeds. You can add a side of Mauritian chili paste (*piment \u00e9cras\u00e9*) or achar for more authenticity.\n\n---\n\n### **Suggestions & Variations:**\n- Mine Frite can easily be turned vegetarian by omitting meat and adding more vegetables or tofu.\n- For added spice, toss in sliced chilies or chili flakes during stir-frying.\n- To recreate the street food feel, serve alongside crispy fries mixed directly with the noodles.\n\nEnjoy your Mauritian **Mine Frite**\u2014a perfect combination of flavors and textures reflecting the island's rich cultural fusion!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 50, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 56, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 58, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 60, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 76, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 60, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2416, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2495, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2366, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2461, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2375, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 3022}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 0, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 0}, "total_time": [48.28168702125549], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [6.178515911102295, 10.942871809005737], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.5575640201568604, 4.626002073287964], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.932190895080566, 5.124805927276611], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [23.818521976470947, 31.110349893569946]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [219, 4624], "completion": [198, 773], "total": [417, 5397]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [60, 57], "completion": [589, 608], "total": [649, 665]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [36, 43], "completion": [652, 658], "total": [688, 701]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [27, 26], "completion": [647, 786], "total": [674, 812]}}}

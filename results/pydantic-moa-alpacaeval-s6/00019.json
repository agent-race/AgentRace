{"query": "instruction: I am going to try to roast a pig at home for Thanksgiving this year. What equipment and techniques do I need to successfully get a pig roasted?", "answer": "You will need a charcoal or wood-burning grill, as well as some tin foil and a roasting pan. You will also need an accurate thermometer to ensure that the pig is cooked to the proper temperature. To roast the pig, you will need to wrap the pig in tin foil and place it in the roasting pan. Place the pan on the grill and cook for several hours, basting periodically with a marinade or other liquid of your choice. Make sure to use the thermometer occasionally to check the internal temperature of the pig, and remove it from the heat once it reaches an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F.", "result": "Here's a comprehensive guide to help you prepare, roast, and serve a pig at home for Thanksgiving:\n\n---\n\n### **1.

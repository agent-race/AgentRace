For more stubborn mineral buildups, it's best to soak it overnight for optimal results.\n\n3. **Remove and Rinse:**\n   - Take the showerhead out of the bag.\n   - Rinse it thoroughly with warm water to wash away any lingering vinegar and loosened mineral deposits.\n\n4. **Optional Scrub:**\n   - If there are still some stubborn spots, you can use an old toothbrush to gently scrub away any remaining deposits.\n\n5. **Reattach:**\n   - After cleaning, reattach the showerhead back onto your shower fixture.\n\n### **Bonus Tip**: \n- Wipe the showerhead with a microfiber cloth afterward for extra shine.\n\nThis method is not only easy but also effective at dissolving and removing lime scale and other mineral deposits without the need for harsh chemicals.

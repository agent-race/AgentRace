Here's how you can make it at home:\n\n---\n\n### **Ingredients:**\n1. **Snails:**  \n   - 12\u201324 snails (fresh, frozen, or canned). You can buy pre-cooked snails or prepare fresh snails.\n\n2. **Herb Garlic Butter Mixture:**\n   - **Butter:** 1 cup (softened, unsalted).  \n   - **Garlic:** 4 cloves (minced).  \n   - **Shallots:** Optional (finely minced).  \n   - **Parsley:** 2\u20133 tablespoons (finely chopped).  \n   - **Thyme:** 1 tablespoon (fresh) or 1 teaspoon (dried).  \n   - **Lemon juice:** 1 teaspoon or splash of white wine.  \n   - **Salt and pepper:** To taste.  \n   - **Paprika (optional).**\n\n3. **Additional Options:**\n   - **Snail shells:** For baked presentation (some recipes use ramekins or muffin tins).  \n   - **French baguette:** For serving.  \n\n---\n\n### **Preparation Step-by-Step:**\n#### 1. **Prepare Snails:**\n   - If **frozen or canned snails**, drain, rinse, and pat dry.  \n   - If fresh snails, clean and purge them with water for removal of impurities. Boil for 10\u201315 minutes. Remove from their shells.\n\n#### 2. **Create Garlic-Herb Butter Mixture:**\n   - Combine softened butter, minced garlic, parsley, shallots, thyme, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and optional paprika in a bowl. Mix thoroughly.\n\n#### 3. **Stuffing Snails:**\n   - Spoon some butter mixture into each snail shell. Place the snail inside the shell, and generously top with more garlic butter.\n\n#### 4. **Arrange for Baking:**\n   - Place snails into an escargot dish, ramekins, or a baking dish. Drizzle white wine or broth lightly over the top.\n\n#### 5. **Bake:**\n   - Preheat oven to 375\u2013400\u00b0F (190\u2013200\u00b0C).\n   - Bake for 10\u201315 minutes, until butter is bubbling and fragrant.\n\n#### 6. **Serve Your Escargot:**\n   - Serve immediately, traditionally with toasted French baguette slices to scoop up the garlic butter sauce.\n   - Escargot forks or tongs can be used for extracting the snails from the shells.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Tips:**\n- **Flavor Variations:** Add a splash of Pernod (licorice-like wine) or cayenne pepper for a twist.\n- **Fresh vs. Canned:** Canned snails are easier, but fresh snails require extra purging and cleaning.\n- **Presentation:** If you don\u2019t have snail shells, use muffin tins or ramekins for a similar effect.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to pair escargot with a crisp white wine such as Sauvignon Blanc or Chablis.

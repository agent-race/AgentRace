Let it sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. For best results, leave the pork uncovered in the refrigerator overnight to dry the skin, which is key for crispy crackling.\n\n2. **Season the Meat:**\n   - Rub the underside (meat side) with black pepper, thyme, and optional spices like caraway and coriander seeds. Insert whole cloves into scored cuts if using.\n   - Optionally place bay leaves under the pork for additional aroma.\n\n3. **Roast the Pork:**\n   - Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0C (425\u00b0F).\n   - Place the pork on a rack in a roasting pan, skin-side up. Add quartered onions and a little water/stock to the pan to prevent burning.\n   - Roast for 30 minutes at high heat to crisp the skin.\n   - Reduce heat to 180\u00b0C (350\u00b0F). Baste occasionally with pan juices or melted butter and roast for 1.5-2 hours, or until internal temperature reaches 65-70\u00b0C (150-160\u00b0F).\n\n4. **Crisp the Crackling (Optional):**\n   - If the skin isn\u2019t fully crisp, increase the heat for the last few minutes of roasting or briefly broil watching closely to avoid burning.\n\n5. **Rest & Serve:**\n   - Let the pork rest for 15-20 minutes before slicing.\n   - Serve with crispy crackling, Danish brown gravy made from pan drippings, boiled or caramelized potatoes, red cabbage, and pickled cucumbers.\n\n#### Tips:\n- To achieve perfect crackling, ensure the skin is dry before roasting and start at a high initial temperature.\n- Fl\u00e6skesteg is traditionally served during holidays like Christmas but can be enjoyed any time of the year. It pairs well with Danish dishes like caramelized potatoes and red cabbage.\n\nEnjoy your delicious homemade Fl\u00e6skesteg, a true taste of Danish cuisine!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 45, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 45, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 45, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 45, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 45, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 45, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 45, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 45, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 45, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 45, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 45, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 45, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 2298, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2763, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2633, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 2300, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 6224, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 7683, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 7683, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2630, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2280, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 2280, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 2617, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2537}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 0, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 0}, "total_time": [660.1251649856567], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [4.522395133972168, 631.6306250095367], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.7010581493377686, 7.322724103927612, 8.079178810119629, 15.753496170043945], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.772345066070557, 12.810390949249268, 12.960633039474487, 13.448837041854858], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [19.228178024291992, 19.18468999862671, 20.912551879882812, 23.889055967330933]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [322, 13208], "completion": [353, 648], "total": [675, 13856]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [57, 57, 57, 57], "completion": [574, 652, 573, 668], "total": [631, 709, 630, 725]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [35, 35, 35, 35], "completion": [766, 2048, 2048, 2048], "total": [801, 2083, 2083, 2083]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [25, 25, 25, 25], "completion": [616, 616, 735, 698], "total": [641, 641, 760, 723]}}}

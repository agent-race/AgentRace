Mild, non-toxic, and biodegradable soaps like Dawn or Joy are great choices.\n- **Glycerin:** Optional but recommended for stronger and longer-lasting bubbles. Use about 1 tablespoon to 1/2 cup.\n- **Sugar:** Optional, helps to strengthen bubbles. Use about 1 teaspoon to 2 tablespoons.\n- **Corn Syrup:** Another option for stronger bubbles, can be used as a substitute for glycerin.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. **Mix Water and Soap:** Combine the water and dish soap in a large bowl and stir gently until the soap dissolves, trying to avoid creating too many suds.\n\n2. **Add Additional Ingredients:** Add the glycerin or corn syrup to the mix. This helps with bubble strength and longevity. If using sugar, add it too and stir until dissolved.\n\n3. **Let it Sit:** Allow the mixture to rest for at least an hour or overnight for the best results; this helps the ingredients to bond.\n\n4. **Test and Adjust:** Dip a bubble wand into the solution and blow to test the bubbles. Adjust by adding more soap or water as needed for desired bubble quality.\n\n### Optional Enhancements:\n- **Colors:** Add food coloring for colorful bubbles, though be aware it might stain surfaces.\n- **Scent:** Add a few drops of essential oils for a pleasant aroma.\n- **Consistency Variations:** Experiment with adding corn syrup for thicker bubbles or adjusting soap concentration for different bubble durability.\n\n### Tips for Use:\n- **Bubble Wands:** Experiment with different designs from items like pipe cleaners, straws, and coat hangers to make unique bubble shapes.\n- **Storage:** Store in an airtight container to keep the solution fresh for future use.\n\nThis essentially makes a fun, safe, and effective bubble solution for both kids and adults to enjoy!

Allow it to sit for **5\u201310 minutes** until it becomes foamy.\n\n2. **Prepare the Dough**:\n   - In a large mixing bowl, mix the flour and salt.\n   - In another bowl, beat the eggs, oil, and honey.\n   - Pour the yeast mixture and egg mixture into the flour. Stir until a shaggy dough forms.\n\n3. **Knead the Dough**:\n   - Knead the dough by hand for **8\u201310 minutes** or use a stand mixer with a dough hook for **5\u20137 minutes** until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough feels sticky, dust lightly with flour as you knead.\n\n4. **First Rise**:\n   - Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for **1\u20131.5 hours** or until it doubles in size.\n\n5. **Shape the Loaves**:\n   - Punch down the dough and divide into **3 equal pieces** (or more for multi-strand braiding).\n   - Roll each piece into a rope of equal length.\n   - Braid the ropes tightly, and pinch the ends so the braid sticks neatly. Tuck the ends underneath the loaf.\n\n6. **Second Rise**:\n   - Place the braided loaf on a parchment-lined baking sheet and allow it to rise uncovered for **30\u201345 minutes**, or until puffy.\n\n7. **Egg Wash**:\n   - Preheat the oven to **375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C)**.\n   - Beat the remaining egg with **1 tablespoon water** and brush it generously over the top surface of the loaf.\n   - Sprinkle sesame or poppy seeds if desired.\n\n8. **Bake**:\n   - Bake the loaf for **25\u201330 minutes**, or until golden brown and it sounds hollow when tapped on the base.\n   - If the loaf is browning too quickly, loosely tent it with aluminum foil during the last 10 minutes.\n\n9. **Cool**:\n   - Remove from the oven and let it cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.\n\n---\n\n### **Optional Variations**:\n- Add **raisins or dried cranberries** to the dough for extra sweetness.\n- Use **whole wheat flour** (substituting up to half the all-purpose flour) for a heartier texture.\n- Brush the egg wash twice during baking for an ultra-glossy crust.\n- Sprinkle **everything bagel seasoning** for a savory twist.\n\nEnjoy your homemade challah bread, whether as a centerpiece for celebrations, French toast, or simple sandwiches!

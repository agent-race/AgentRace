{"query": "instruction: What is kevlar made out of?", "answer": "Kevlar is made out of poly-paraphenylene terephthalamide, a type of synthetic fiber.", "result": "Kevlar is a synthetic fiber made from a polymer known as poly-para-phenylene terephthalamide. It is a type of aramid fiber, which is specifically known for its high strength and resistance to impact. The polymer chains are aligned parallel to each other and woven tightly, which contributes to its exceptional properties. Kevlar is used in a wide range of applications, including body armor, helmets, and other protective gear, due to its strength and durability.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [2.2775790691375732], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [2.26330304145813]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [279], "completion": [97], "total": [376]}}}

{"query": "instruction: Who was the first lead vocal for the rock band Starship?", "answer": "Grace Slick was the first lead vocal for the rock band Starship.", "result": "There is some variation in the responses regarding the first lead vocalist for Starship. This largely stems from the band's origins and its evolution from Jefferson Airplane to Jefferson Starship, and finally to Starship.\n\n1. **Mickey Thomas** is cited by several responses as the primary lead vocalist when the band officially became **Starship** in 1984. Mickey Thomas had been associated with Jefferson Starship since 1979 and carried over his role into the new iteration of the band, becoming the distinctive voice behind hits like *\"We Built This City\"* and *\"Nothing\u2019s Gonna Stop Us Now.\"*\n\n2. **Grace Slick**, however, is recognized as a foundational vocalist in the band's lineage, spanning back to the Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship days. Some responses suggest she was associated with Starship in its early stages or share her iconic role in the band's history.\n\nIn conclusion, **Mickey Thomas** is most commonly regarded as the first lead vocalist for Starship (specifically under that name starting in the 1980s). However, **Grace Slick**'s influence on the band's broader history is also significant, particularly during its earlier iterations.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 56, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 56, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 56, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 56, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 56, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 56, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 56, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 56, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 56, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 56, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 56, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 56, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 234, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 234, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 234, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 234, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 325, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 333, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 333, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 333, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 654, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 619, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 771, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 849}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 0, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 0}, "total_time": [280.06590008735657], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [32.75849199295044, 237.9530258178711], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [1.2293879985809326, 1.2852540016174316, 1.3326129913330078, 1.471545934677124], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [1.579862117767334, 1.6140949726104736, 1.6639997959136963, 1.9018728733062744], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [6.485176086425781, 6.6424009799957275, 8.859863042831421, 9.295023202896118]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [284, 1865], "completion": [365, 239], "total": [649, 2104]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [36, 36, 36, 36], "completion": [59, 59, 59, 59], "total": [95, 95, 95, 95]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [58, 58, 58, 58], "completion": [70, 72, 72, 72], "total": [128, 130, 130, 130]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [26, 26, 26, 26], "completion": [154, 155, 183, 205], "total": [180, 181, 209, 231]}}}

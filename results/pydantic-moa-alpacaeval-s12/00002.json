{"query": "instruction: Hi, my sister and her girlfriends want me to play kickball with them. Can you explain how the game is played, so they don't take advantage of me?", "answer": "Kickball is a game similar to baseball, but with a large rubber ball instead of a bat and a ball. The game is usually played with two teams of six players each. Each team has three bases and a home plate. The players on the kicking team line up at home plate and take turns kicking the ball. The object of the game is to score runs by running around all three bases and back to home plate without being tagged out by the defense. The team with the most runs at the end of the game is the winner.", "result": "Kickball is a fun and energetic game combining elements of baseball and soccer.

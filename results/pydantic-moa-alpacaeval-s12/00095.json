{"query": "instruction: When were smart phones first made?", "answer": "The first smartphone was the IBM Simon, which was released in 1994.", "result": "The concept of a smartphone originated in the early 1990s, with a few notable devices paving the way for the modern smartphones we use today. Here's a timeline highlighting key milestones:\n\n1. **IBM Simon (1994):** Often regarded as the first true smartphone. It combined a mobile phone with a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) and featured a touchscreen, email, and fax capabilities.\n\n2. **Nokia 9000 Communicator (1996):** Among the first widely recognized smartphones, which included a full QWERTY keyboard and internet capabilities.\n\n3. **Ericsson R380 (2000):** Marketed as a \"smartphone,\" it ran the Symbian OS and had limited touchscreen capabilities.\n\n4. **BlackBerry (Early 2000s):** Popularized in the business sector for its email and messaging features, solidifying the concept of smartphones.\n\n5. **Nokia 7110 (1999):** Known for its basic internet capabilities and touchscreen, an early precursor to modern smartphones.\n\n6. **Apple iPhone (2007):** This device revolutionized the smartphone industry with a multi-touch interface, a robust operating system (iOS), and the introduction of the App Store, setting the standard for modern smartphones.\n\n7. **Android (2008 - HTC Dream/G1):** The first Android-powered smartphone, marking the emergence of Google's competing platform.\n\nWhile the term \"smartphone\" wasn't widely used until the 2000s, these devices laid the groundwork for the smartphones we use today. The modern smartphone era, notably marked by the launch of the iPhone, vastly expanded the functionality and user experience.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 34, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 34, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 34, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 34, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 34, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 34, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 34, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 34, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 34, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 34, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 34, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 34, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 667, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 655, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 655, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 667, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 997, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 997, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 997, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 1505, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 1232, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 1222, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 1448, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 1402}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 0}, "total_time": [20.338851928710938], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [3.347672939300537, 5.399754047393799], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [1.7986109256744385, 1.7490148544311523, 1.951125144958496, 1.9870350360870361], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [2.080190896987915, 2.0452208518981934, 2.0674729347229004, 3.1331329345703125], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [9.926612138748169, 10.763260126113892, 11.08220386505127, 11.516890048980713]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [278, 3501], "completion": [293, 337], "total": [571, 3838]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [30, 30, 30, 30], "completion": [152, 144, 144, 152], "total": [182, 174, 174, 182]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [52, 52, 52, 52], "completion": [209, 209, 209, 316], "total": [261, 261, 261, 368]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [20, 20, 20, 20], "completion": [282, 270, 324, 315], "total": [302, 290, 344, 335]}}}

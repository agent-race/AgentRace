Enjoy!", "result": "Here's a compiled recipe for Somali Canjeero, the traditional flatbread often enjoyed with Somali stews and sauces:\n\n### Somali Canjeero Recipe\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- **2 cups of teff flour** (substitute with all-purpose flour if teff is unavailable)\n- **1/2 cup fine cornmeal or sorghum flour** (optional for texture)\n- **1 tsp salt**\n- **1 tsp sugar** (to aid fermentation)\n- **1 tsp instant yeast** (or \u00bd tsp active dry yeast)\n- **2\u00bd cups warm water** (adjust as necessary)\n- **1 tsp baking powder** (add this just before cooking for extra fluffiness)\n\n#### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Batter:**\n   - Mix the flour, cornmeal (if using), salt, sugar, and yeast in a large bowl.\n   - Gradually add warm water while stirring to achieve a smooth, thin batter. The consistency should be similar to pancake batter, but slightly runnier.\n   - Cover the bowl with a clean cloth and let the batter ferment for 6\u201312 hours (or overnight) at room temperature. The longer it ferments, the more tangy and bubbly it becomes.\n\n2. **Cook the Canjeero:**\n   - After fermentation, stir in the baking powder.\n   - Heat a non-stick skillet or a traditional griddle (tawa) over medium-low heat. Grease lightly with oil using a cloth.\n   - Pour a ladleful of batter onto the skillet, swirling it quickly to form a thin, even circle (about 8-10 inches in diameter).\n   - Cook without flipping until the top is set and covered with tiny bubbles (about 2\u20133 minutes). The bottom should be lightly golden and the Canjeero should be soft and spongy.\n\n3. **Serve:**\n   - Stack the Canjeero on a plate and serve warm.\n   - Typically served with Somali stews (maraq), suugo (tomato sauce), or with sweet toppings like honey and ghee.\n\n#### Tips:\n- For a more sour authentic taste, ferment the batter longer (up to 24 hours).\n- If the batter is too thick, dilute with additional water before cooking.\n- Canjeero can be stored in a cloth to keep them soft and warmed up when needed.\n\nEnjoy making and sharing this delightful Somali dish with your guests!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 37, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 37, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 37, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 37, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 37, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 37, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 37, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 37, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 37, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 37, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 37, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 37, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2035, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 1989, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2035, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 2006, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 2232, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2277, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2330, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 2769, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2400, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 1997, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 2342, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2342}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 0, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 0, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 0, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 0}, "total_time": [57.20764994621277], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [11.308643102645874, 16.298119068145752], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.911910057067871, 4.080195903778076, 4.101078987121582, 8.947074890136719], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.912813186645508, 4.403895139694214, 4.734536170959473, 4.939505100250244], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [15.489468812942505, 17.19544506072998, 29.479170083999634, 29.524159908294678]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [321, 7791], "completion": [317, 493], "total": [638, 8284]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [54, 54, 54, 54], "completion": [500, 500, 489, 680], "total": [554, 554, 543, 734]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [32, 32, 32, 32], "completion": [506, 558, 563, 582], "total": [538, 590, 595, 614]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [22, 22, 22, 22], "completion": [625, 523, 584, 584], "total": [647, 545, 606, 606]}}}

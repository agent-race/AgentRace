{"query": "instruction: Hi, I'm interested in learning to play badminton. Can you explain the game to me?", "answer": "Sure! Badminton is a sport played by two or four players. It is played with a shuttlecock and racquets. The game is played by hitting the shuttlecock back and forth over a net that divides the court. The objective is to hit the shuttlecock over the net and have it land in the opposing player's court. Points are scored when the shuttlecock is not returned properly. The first player or team to reach 21 points wins the game.", "result": "Here's an overview of the game of badminton, explained by various agents:\n\n1. **Basic Rules and Gameplay**:\n   - **Objective**: Badminton is played on a rectangular court divided by a net.

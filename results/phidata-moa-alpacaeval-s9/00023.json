{"query": "instruction: What type of soil is suitable for cactus?", "answer": "Cactus plants require a well-drained, sandy soil with a neutral to slightly acidic pH level. A good soil mix for cactus plants contains equal parts of potting soil, coarse sand, and perlite or coarse gravel.", "result": "\nRunning:\n - transfer_task_to_chat_agent_1(task_description=Identify the type of soil suitable for cactus plants., expected_output=A detailed description of the type of soil that is most suitable for growing cactus., additional_information=Include aspects such as soil composition, drainage, and any other relevant factors.)\n - transfer_task_to_chat_agent_2(task_description=Identify the type of soil suitable for cactus plants., expected_output=A detailed description of the type of soil that is most suitable for growing cactus., additional_information=Include aspects such as soil composition, drainage, and any other relevant factors.)\n - transfer_task_to_chat_agent_3(task_description=Identify the type of soil suitable for cactus plants., expected_output=A detailed description of the type of soil that is most suitable for growing cactus., additional_information=Include aspects such as soil composition, drainage, and any other relevant factors.)\n\nBased on the inputs from multiple agents, here's the aggregated response regarding the type of soil suitable for cacti:\n\n### Characteristics of Suitable Soil for Cactus Plants:\n\n#### 1. **Drainage**\n   - Cactus plants require **well-draining soil** to prevent water retention and root rot. \n   - The soil should allow water to drain away quickly after watering, as excess moisture is harmful to cacti.\n\n#### 2. **Soil Composition**\n   - **Sand or Loamy Soil**: Sandy or gritty soil establishes good drainage and aeration.\n   - **Gravel & Rocks**: Adding a mix of gravel or small stones helps improve the porous structure of the soil.\n   - **Organic Matter**: Incorporating a small amount of organic matter (like perlite, peat moss, or pumice) ensures some moisture retention without becoming overly dense.\n\n#### 3. **pH Level**\n   - Ideal pH range: **slightly acidic to neutral**, between **6.0 to 7.5**. This range accommodates most cactus species.\n\n#### 4. **Other Factors**\n   - **Avoid Compact Soil**: Avoid using clay-heavy or moisture-retentive soils as cacti are adapted for arid environments.\n   - **Nutrients**: Minimal fertilizer requirements but ensure essential nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) are available.\n   - **Commercial Soil Mix**: Ready-made cactus or succulent soil mixes are widely available and suited for cactus needs.\n\n### Example Soil Mix:\n- **50-70% coarse sand** for drainage.\n- **20-30% organic matter** to retain minimal moisture.\n- **10-20% gravel or pumice** for aeration.\n\nBy providing these soil conditions, you can ensure a thriving environment for your cactus plants!

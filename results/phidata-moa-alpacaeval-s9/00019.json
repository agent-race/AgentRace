When they rub against your legs, they deposit their scent, marking you as part of their territory. This behavior helps create a familiar and comforting environment for them.\n\n### 2. **Social Bonding and Affection**\nRubbing against your legs is a form of social bonding. It signifies trust, affection, and comfort with you, resembling social grooming behaviors observed among cats in colonies. This action indicates that you are an important part of their social circle.\n\n### 3. **Communication**\nCats use scent marking as a communication tool. The scent left on humans conveys information about their identity, emotional state, and health. This is a silent way of ensuring the other cats perceive their presence and status in the household.\n\n### 4. **Attention Seeking**\nSometimes, cats rub against human legs to seek attention or initiate interaction. They have learned that this behavior often leads to positive outcomes such as petting, feeding, or playtime.\n\n### 5. **Self-Soothing**\nRubbing can be a stress-reduction mechanism, especially in unfamiliar environments. It allows cats to spread their scent and make their surroundings, including their human companions, feel more familiar.\n\n### 6. **Playfulness**\nCats may rub against you in a playful manner to engage in games or activities, using this action as part of their social interaction arsenal.\n\n### Scientific Insight\nResearch emphasizes pheromone communication among cats and highlights how behaviors like *allorubbing* serve to reinforce social bonds. Studies also show that scent-marking behaviors are common in cats with close ties, underlining their role as a bonding mechanism.\n\nIn summary, cats rub against human legs due to a combination of territorial marking, social bonding, communication, attention seeking, self-soothing, and playfulness. Understanding these motivations helps strengthen the bond between humans and their feline friends.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 225, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 7169, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 257, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 7120, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 285, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 6391}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 3254, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 3209, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2827}, "total_time": [88.42537593841553], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [47.077507972717285, 6.92480206489563], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [7.7709691524505615], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.5521740913391113], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [15.907490968704224]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1488, 3341], "completion": [199, 408], "total": [1687, 3749]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [93], "completion": [536], "total": [629]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [76], "completion": [524], "total": [600]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [71], "completion": [490], "total": [561]}}}

However, blood can appear in colors other than red under certain conditions.\n\n### Circumstances Affecting Blood Color\n\n#### Oxygenation Levels\n- **Oxygenated Blood**: Found in arteries, appears bright red.\n- **Deoxygenated Blood**: Found in veins, may appear darker or purplish.\n\n#### Biological Conditions\n- **Carbon Monoxide Poisoning**: Causes blood to appear bright red or cherry-red.\n- **Methemoglobinemia**: Gives blood a cyanotic or blue appearance due to oxidized hemoglobin.\n- **Bilirubin Presence**: Causes blood to appear yellowish or greenish, seen in liver dysfunction.\n\n#### Lighting Conditions\n- **Natural Light**: Properly illuminates blood color; low light may make it appear darker.\n- **Artificial Light**: Can alter perceived color; fluorescent lights might make blood appear greenish.\n\n### Unusual Instances of Human Blood Appearing in Different Colors\n\n#### Green Blood (Sulfhemoglobinemia)\n- **Caused by**: Sulfur binding to hemoglobin.\n- **Reported Cases**:\n  - A Canadian patient in 2007 with green blood due to medication.\n  - 2019 case of sulfhemoglobinemia from benzocaine.\n\n#### Blue or Purple Blood (Methemoglobinemia)\n- **Caused by**: Elevated methemoglobin.\n- **Reported Cases**:\n  - Hereditary methemoglobinemia in the Blue Fugates of Kentucky.\n\n#### Black Blood\n- **Caused by**: Extreme methemoglobinemia or toxin exposure.\n- **Reported Cases**:\n  - Black blood reported in acute lead poisoning.\n\n#### Yellow or White Blood\n- **Caused by**:\n  - **Lipemia**: High fat content causes milky plasma.\n  - **Leukemia**: High white blood cell counts may tint blood pale yellow.\n\n### Cultural References\n\n- **Mythological**: Ancient Greek myths described golden blood of gods.\n- **Cultural**: Some cultures associate blue blood with nobility.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAlthough human blood is generally red, several biological, environmental, and genetic factors can alter its color. Understanding and identifying these factors are essential for diagnosing related medical conditions.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 352, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 6672, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 292, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 6949, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 294, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 8248}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2942, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 3106, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 3751}, "total_time": [83.71178197860718], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.944862127304077, 20.380961179733276], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [19.187071800231934], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.692428827285767], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [27.124440908432007]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1486, 3633], "completion": [225, 504], "total": [1711, 4137]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [116], "completion": [507], "total": [623]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [79], "completion": [532], "total": [611]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [69], "completion": [727], "total": [796]}}}

Here\u2019s how they occur:\n\n1. **Origin of Particles**:\n   - The sun emits a stream of charged particles known as the **solar wind**. These particles include electrons and protons.\n   \n2. **Earth\u2019s Magnetic Shield**:\n   - The Earth\u2019s magnetic field acts as a shield, protecting us by redirecting these charged particles towards the polar regions.\n   \n3. **Collision with the Atmosphere**:\n   - As these particles approach the poles, they collide with gases in the Earth's atmosphere, such as **oxygen** and **nitrogen**.\n   \n4. **Emission of Light**:\n   - These collisions release energy in the form of **light**, visible as the aurora. The color of the aurora depends on the type of gas and the energy of the collision.\n   \n5. **Colors of the Aurora**:\n   - **Green**: This is the most common color, produced by oxygen molecules located about 60 miles (about 100 kilometers) above the Earth.\n   - **Red**: Produced by higher-altitude oxygen, at heights of up to 200 miles (about 320 kilometers).\n   - **Blue/Purple**: Caused by nitrogen; this can also produce purples and violets.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe auroras are a stunning display resulting from solar particles colliding with atmospheric gases, guided by Earth's magnetic field, and releasing energy as beautiful lights in the sky. These lights are predominantly seen in high-latitude regions around the Arctic and Antarctic. Understanding the northern lights broadens our appreciation for these breathtaking natural displays. \n\nFeel free to ask if you have any more questions about this fascinating phenomenon!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 260, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 7052, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 284, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 4755, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 235, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2333}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 3178, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2013, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 823}, "total_time": [43.90338206291199], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [10.232978820800781, 16.583690881729126], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.857290029525757], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [2.491395950317383], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [2.702242851257324]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1482, 2608], "completion": [196, 396], "total": [1678, 3004]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [99], "completion": [540], "total": [639]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [77], "completion": [285], "total": [362]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [60], "completion": [55], "total": [115]}}}

His voyages marked the beginning of European interest in the region but did not lead to permanent settlement.\n\n---\n\n#### **French Colonization (Early Settlement)**\n- **1604**: The first European settlement was established at **Port-Royal (Nova Scotia)** by French explorers **Pierre Du Gua de Monts** and **Samuel de Champlain**.\n- **1608**: **Samuel de Champlain** founded **Quebec City**, marking the start of sustained colonization in what became known as **New France**.\n- **1642**: **Montreal** was established as a missionary settlement, expanding French influence.\n\n---\n\n#### **British Colonization & Dominance**\n- **1713**: The **Treaty of Utrecht** marked a shift in power, ceding parts of Acadia (Nova Scotia) and Newfoundland from France to Britain.\n- **1759**: The **Battle of the Plains of Abraham** near Quebec City led to British victory over French forces.\n- **1763**: The **Treaty of Paris** formally ended French rule in Canada, transferring most territories to the British.\n  \n---\n\n#### **Post-Colonial Developments**\n- **1791**: The **Constitutional Act** divided Canada into:\n  - **Upper Canada** (English-speaking)\n  - **Lower Canada** (French-speaking)\n- **1867**: The **Canadian Confederation** united provinces into the **Dominion of Canada**, marking a step toward self-governance within the British Empire.\n\n---\n\n#### **Key Notes**\n- **Exploration vs. Colonization**: Early visits by Europeans in the 16th century (e.g., Jacques Cartier in 1534) were for exploration. Colonization began in earnest with the founding of settlements like Quebec in **1608**.\n- **Impact on Indigenous Populations**: Colonization heavily disrupted indigenous communities through displacement and cultural marginalization.\n\n---\n\nIn summary, Canada's colonization unfolded over centuries, beginning with French efforts in the 16th century and transitioning to British rule by the 18th century. Major events\u2014such as the founding of Quebec City in 1608\u2014signify the start of the permanent European presence in Canada.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 352, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 6492, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 289, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 5272, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 334, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 5594}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2852, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2269, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2404}, "total_time": [63.76000499725342], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [10.264705181121826, 29.55160403251648], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.451910972595215], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.4269649982452393], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [7.237185955047607]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1482, 3018], "completion": [233, 538], "total": [1715, 3556]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [111], "completion": [447], "total": [558]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [81], "completion": [359], "total": [440]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [78], "completion": [408], "total": [486]}}}

Below is a step-by-step guide to help you keep your wooden table in excellent condition.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Regular Cleaning**\n**Why:** Regular cleaning prevents dirt, dust, and stains that can damage the wood.  \n\n- **Dust Daily:** Use a soft, lint-free microfiber cloth to remove dust particles.\n- **Mild Cleaning:** Mix a solution of warm water and mild dish soap. Lightly dampen a cloth, wring it out to remove excess water, and wipe the table.  \n- **Important Tips:**  \n  - Do not soak the table. Too much moisture can warp the wood.  \n  - Avoid harsh cleaners or abrasive materials, as these can strip the finish.  \n- **Dry Thoroughly:** Use a clean, dry cloth to wipe away moisture after cleaning.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Deep Cleaning**\n**When Needed:** For sticky grime or accumulated oil and dirt.  \n\n- **For Sticky Stains:** Mix equal parts water and white vinegar. Gently clean the surface and dry with a clean cloth.  \n- **Handling Buildup:** Use mineral spirits carefully to remove grease or wax buildup, but test it on a hidden area first.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Polishing and Conditioning**\n**Why:** Polishing enhances the table\u2019s shine, while conditioning prevents wood from drying and cracking.  \n\n- Use a high-quality furniture polish or natural beeswax wood conditioner.  \n- Apply with a soft cloth, working in the direction of the wood grain.  \n- Buff the surface afterward to bring out the shine.  \n- **Frequency:** Every 3\u20136 months depending on usage and exposure.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Protecting the Surface**\n**Prevention is key.**  \n\n- **Use Coasters and Placemats:** Protect against water stains, heat damage, and scratches.\n- **Minimize Sunlight Exposure:** UV rays can cause discoloration and fading. Keep the table away from direct sunlight.\n- **Keep Humidity Stable:** Extreme moisture or dryness can warp wood. Ideal humidity: 40-60%.  \n- **Avoid Dragging Objects:** Lift decorations or items instead of sliding them to prevent scratches.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Responding to Accidents**\n- **Spills:** Wipe immediately with a dry or slightly damp cloth to prevent water stains.  \n- **Water Rings:** Rub gently with baking soda and water paste or try mayonnaise. Wipe clean and dry.  \n\n---\n\n### **6. Repair Tips for Minor Damage**\n- **Scratches:** Use a walnut or a pecan to rub over shallow scratches as a natural remedy. Alternatively, touch up with colored wood markers or wax fillers.  \n- **Dents:** Steam lightly using a damp cloth and iron.  \n\n---\n\n### **7. Long-Term Maintenance**\nIf the finish begins to wear:  \n- Sand down lightly with fine-grit sandpaper.  \n- Apply a protective finish (e.g., polyurethane) for durability.  \n\n---\n\nBy following these steps, you can extend the life of your wooden table and keep it looking as elegant as the day you bought it. Always remember: gentle cleaning, consistent maintenance, and proactive protection will keep your table in top-notch condition for years!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 341, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 7789, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 341, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 8378, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 341, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 9211}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 3506, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 3796, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 4209}, "total_time": [68.70129609107971], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [17.588956117630005, 11.399961948394775], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.677046060562134], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.485713005065918], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [23.121613025665283]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1486, 4192], "completion": [251, 700], "total": [1737, 4892]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [115], "completion": [621], "total": [736]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [93], "completion": [721], "total": [814]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [83], "completion": [867], "total": [950]}}}

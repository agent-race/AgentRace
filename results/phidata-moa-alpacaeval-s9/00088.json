Submerge the nib fully into the ink bottle.\n  2. Twist the piston knob (or operate the lever/sac) to draw ink.\n  3. Wait a few seconds for full saturation.\n  4. Gently wipe excess ink from the nib.\n\n- **Option B: Using a Converter:**\n  1. Attach the converter to the nib section and dip the nib in ink.\n  2.

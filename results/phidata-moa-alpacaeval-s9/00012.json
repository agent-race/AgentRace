It's versatile and often served with stews, honey, or ghee. Follow this recipe to recreate an authentic Canjeero experience!\n\n---\n\n## **Ingredients**\n*(Makes 8-10 Canjeeros)*\n- **2 cups** all-purpose flour (or a mix of all-purpose and sorghum flour for authenticity)\n- **1 cup** fine cornmeal (optional, for texture)\n- **1 tsp** salt\n- **1 tsp** sugar\n- **1 tsp** active dry yeast\n- **2 cups** warm water\n- **\u00bd cup** plain yogurt or buttermilk (for tanginess)\n- **1 tsp** baking powder (optional, for extra fluffiness)\n- **Oil** (for greasing the pan)\n\n---\n\n## **Preparation Steps**\n\n### **1. Prepare the Batter**\n1. Combine the flour, cornmeal (if using), salt, sugar, and yeast in a large mixing bowl.\n2. Gradually add warm water while whisking or stirring to avoid lumps.\n3. Mix in the yogurt or buttermilk, ensuring the batter is smooth and slightly runny, like pancake batter but thinner.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Fermentation**\n1. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen cloth and place it in a warm spot.\n2. Let the batter ferment for **6-8 hours or overnight**. The batter should rise and develop a slightly tangy aroma.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Adjust the Batter**\n1. After fermentation, stir the batter gently. Add a little water if the consistency is too thick.\n2. Optionally, stir in the baking powder before cooking for extra fluffiness.\n\n---\n\n## **Cooking Process**\n\n### **1. Preheat the Pan**\n- Use a non-stick skillet or a traditional Canjeero pan. Heat it over medium-low heat and lightly oil the surface.\n\n### **2. Spread the Batter**\n1. Pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the pan.\n2. Tilt the pan in a circular motion to spread the batter evenly into a thin layer.\n\n### **3. Cook the Canjeero**\n1. Let the batter cook uncovered for about **2-3 minutes** until small holes appear on the surface, and the edges start to lift.\n2. Only cook one side\u2014the top remains soft and pillowy, while the bottom should be lightly golden.\n3. Carefully remove the Canjeero without flipping and transfer it to a plate.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Repeat and Stack**\n- Repeat the process with the remaining batter, stacking the Canjeeros on a plate and covering them with a clean cloth to keep them warm and soft.\n\n---\n\n## **Serving Suggestions**\n- Serve warm with **Somali stews**, such as _Suqaar_ (stewed meat) or _Maraq_ (spiced broth).\n- For breakfast, pair with **honey**, **ghee**, or a savory egg dish.\n- Canjeero can also be eaten plain as a utensil-like bread to scoop other dishes.\n\n---\n\n### **Tips for Best Results**\n- **Fermentation:** Allow enough time for the batter to ferment to get the authentic tangy taste.\n- **Consistency:** The batter should be thin and pourable but not watery.\n- **Cooking Heat:** Use medium-low heat for even cooking and avoid burning.\n\n---\n\nEnjoy your Somali Canjeero, and impress your guests with this delightful flatbread!

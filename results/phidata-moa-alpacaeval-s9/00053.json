This step is essential for achieving crispy crackling.\n\n2. **Seasoning:**\n   - Generously rub coarse salt into the scored skin, ensuring it gets into all the cuts. Sprinkle black pepper for added flavor. If desired, insert bay leaves into the cuts for a fragrant note.\n\n3. **Optional Resting:**\n   - Allow the seasoned pork to sit uncovered in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight. This helps dry out the skin, resulting in crispier crackling.\n\n---\n\n#### **Roasting the Pork**\n1. **Preheat the Oven:**\n   - Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0C (400\u00b0F).\n\n2. **Prepare the Roast:**\n   - Place the pork on a rack in a roasting pan, with the scored skin facing up. Add chopped onions and vegetable or pork stock to the pan to enhance the roast\u2019s flavor.\n\n3. **Roast to Perfection:**\n   - Roast in the oven for 1\u00bd\u20132 hours or until the internal temperature reaches 75\u00b0C (165\u00b0F). Check the crackling after 1 hour; if it's not crispy, increase the oven temperature slightly (up to 220\u00b0C / 430\u00b0F) for the final 15 minutes.\n\n4. **Rest the Meat:**\n   - Remove the pork from the oven and let it rest for 10\u201315 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute.\n\n---\n\n#### **Making the Gravy** (Optional)\n1. Pour the juices from the roasting pan into a saucepan.\n2. Melt butter in the saucepan and whisk in flour to form a roux.\n3. Gradually add the juices and stock, stirring until the gravy thickens. Season with salt and pepper.\n\n---\n\n### **Tips for Achieving Perfect Crackling**\n- Ensure the skin is completely dry before seasoning.\n- Use a roasting rack to allow air circulation and prevent the pork from sitting in liquid.\n- If the crackling isn\u2019t crispy, use the broil/grill setting for 2\u20133 minutes at the end of roasting, but keep a close eye to avoid burning.\n\n---\n\n### **Serving Suggestions**\nSlice the pork roast and serve with traditional sides:\n- Boiled or caramelized potatoes\n- Steamed red cabbage\n- Gravy made from roasting juices\n- Apple sauce, if desired, for a sweet contrast.\n\nEnjoy your delicious **Fl\u00e6skesteg**, a true taste of Denmark!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 453, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 6553, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 448, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 8897, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 326, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 3844}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2832, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 4002, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 1533}, "total_time": [62.948872089385986], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [8.157356023788452, 28.167107105255127], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.330504894256592], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.828075885772705], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [10.737421035766602]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1527, 3672], "completion": [312, 790], "total": [1839, 4462]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [142], "completion": [554], "total": [696]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [118], "completion": [850], "total": [968]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [91], "completion": [265], "total": [356]}}}

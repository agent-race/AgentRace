Pooping Log (Catalonia, Spain)**\nIn Catalonia, children care for a log called \"Caga Ti\u00f3.\" It's \"fed\" treats leading up to Christmas, then beaten with sticks on Christmas Eve to \"poop\" presents. \n\n### **2. Krampus (Austria & Germany)**\nInstead of only Santa rewarding good kids, Krampus\u2014Santa\u2019s scary counterpart\u2014punishes naughty ones. Adults dress as Krampus and parade through towns on December 5th.\n\n### **3. KFC Christmas Dinner (Japan)**\nIn Japan, Christmas isn\u2019t traditional but Kentucky Fried Chicken is! A 1970s marketing campaign turned eating KFC into a holiday must, with special dinners booked months in advance.\n\n### **4. Yule Lads (Iceland)**\nInstead of Santa, 13 mischievous trolls visit children over 13 nights leading up to Christmas, either giving gifts or pranks based on good or bad behavior.\n\n### **5.

This stems from a legend where spiders saved a Christmas tree for a poor family.\n\n### **6.

It\u2019s a festive tradition unique to Caracas\u2019 community culture.\n\n### **7.

G\u00e4vle Goat (Sweden)**\nThe town of G\u00e4vle erects a massive straw goat every year.

Lantern Festival (Philippines)**\nIn San Fernando, bright and elaborate lanterns (up to 20 feet wide) light the city during Christmas festivals as part of a competition.\n\nThese traditions showcase how cultures worldwide incorporate their unique customs and creativity into the holiday season!

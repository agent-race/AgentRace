During its waxing, waning, or quarter phases, it can be visible during the day. A full moon, however, is rarely seen in daylight as it rises at sunset and sets at sunrise.\n\n2. **Sunlight Reflection**:\n   - The moon reflects sunlight, making it visible against the bright daytime sky. It reflects about 12% of the sunlight, which is sufficient to be noticeable when its position in the sky is right.\n\n3. **Contrast and Visibility**:\n   - The moon's brightness is enough to stand out, particularly when it's in certain phases like the gibbous or full phase. For example, during the first quarter, the moon is about 90 degrees from the sun, and it can be seen in the afternoon.\n\n4. **Angle and Illumination**:\n   - When the moon is at a significant angular distance from the sun (at least 45 degrees), it receives enough illumination to be visible in the daytime sky.\n\n5. **Atmospheric Conditions**:\n   - Clear skies with minimal cloud cover and little atmospheric scattering can enhance the moon's visibility during the day.\n\n6. **Time and Season**:\n   - The moon is most likely visible in the late morning or early afternoon, depending on the season and its orbit alignment with Earth and the sun.\n\nThese conditions together allow for the unique sight of the moon against the daylight, making it not just a nighttime phenomenon.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 357, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 5977, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 349, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 5942, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 337, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 6727}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2592, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2574, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2969}, "total_time": [57.672945976257324], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [11.10549807548523, 14.719064950942993], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.860869884490967], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [8.89548110961914], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [11.853247880935669]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1486, 3225], "completion": [257, 351], "total": [1743, 3576]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [123], "completion": [424], "total": [547]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [95], "completion": [446], "total": [541]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [78], "completion": [530], "total": [608]}}}

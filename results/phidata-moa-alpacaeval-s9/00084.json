Include fresh vegetables daily and fruits occasionally. Seeds and nuts can be given a few times a week in moderation.\n- **Prohibited Foods:** Avoid sugary foods, salted items, dairy, raw meat, onions, garlic, chocolate, and caffeine.\n\n### General Care Tips\n- **Bonding and Handling:** Interact with your rat daily, using gentle handling and positive reinforcement with treats.\n- **Grooming and Hygiene:** Minimal grooming is needed; clean the cage regularly.\n- **Enrichment and Entertainment:** Provide toys, climbing structures, and supervised play areas.\n- **Health Maintenance:** Watch for signs of illness, and schedule annual check-ups with a vet specializing in exotic pets.\n\nBy following these guidelines, your pet rat will be well-cared-for, healthy, and happy in your home.

{"query": "instruction: Why is kobe beef so damn expensive?", "answer": "Kobe beef is expensive because it is a high-quality, rare breed of beef from the Japanese Wagyu cattle. The cattle are raised in a special way that produces a unique flavor and texture, making it a much sought-after delicacy. Additionally, the process of raising and aging the beef is very labor intensive, and the beef is only available in limited supply.", "result": "\nRunning:\n - transfer_task_to_chat_agent_1(task_description=Explain why Kobe beef is known for its high cost., expected_output=A detailed explanation of the factors contributing to the high cost of Kobe beef., additional_information=...)\n - transfer_task_to_chat_agent_2(task_description=Research and explain the contribution of the rearing and production process to Kobe beef's price., expected_output=Specific details on how the rearing and production methods of Kobe beef influence its cost., additional_information=Focus on the meticulous care of cattle and the quality standards required to qualify as Kobe beef.)\n - transfer_task_to_chat_agent_3(task_description=Discuss the exclusivity and certification process of Kobe beef., expected_output=..., additional_information=Highlight the geographical and regulatory factors restricting Kobe beef production.)\n\nKobe beef's high price can be attributed to several factors, as explained by the agents' responses:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Unique Attributes of Kobe Beef**\n   - **Marbling:** Known for its extraordinary intramuscular fat distribution, Kobe beef has a unique tenderness and flavor that surpasses other types of beef.\n   - **Breed:** It comes exclusively from the Tajima strain of Japanese Black cattle, genetically predisposed to producing such high-quality beef.\n   - **Diet and Care:** The cattle are fed a specialized diet, which includes premium grains, and some are even believed to be massaged to improve their meat quality.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Meticulous Rearing and Production Practices**\n   - **Controlled Rearing:** Raised in a low-stress environment with specific temperature, humidity, and care standards.\n   - **Long Growth Cycle:** Kobe cattle are reared for longer durations (e.g., 60+ months) to maximize marbling and achieve the desired meat quality.\n   - **Butchering and Aging:** The meat undergoes a strict aging process, usually about 28 days, to enhance its flavor profile even further.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Exclusive Certification Process**\n   - **Strict Grading Standards:** Kobe beef must meet stringent conditions, including a high Beef Marbling Standard (BMS) score of at least 6 and an A4 or A5 grade in texture, flavor, and fat quality.\n   - **Geographic Limitations:** Only Tajima cattle raised, slaughtered, and graded within Hyogo Prefecture, Japan, qualify as Kobe beef.\n   - **Traceability:** The rigorous certification includes assigning a 10-digit ID to each cow, ensuring the meat's authenticity and origin.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Exclusivity and Limited Supply**\n   - **Low Production Numbers:** Annually, fewer than 5,000 cattle meet the Kobe beef standards, representing only 0.06% of Japan\u2019s total beef production.\n   - **High Demand:** The limited availability makes it highly sought-after, particularly by fine-dining restaurants worldwide.\n   - **Export Regulations:** For many years, Kobe beef was rarely available outside Japan, further driving its desirability and cost when accessible internationally.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thought:\nKobe beef represents the epitome of luxury dining. Its high cost stems from the devotion to preserving its quality through meticulous rearing, stringent certification standards, and its global demand as an exclusive, high-end product. Prices can range from $200 to over $1,000 per pound, making it one of the most expensive steaks in the world.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 284, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 7596, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 338, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 8575, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 299, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 5355}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 3438, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 3896, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2302}, "total_time": [98.38538098335266], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.128695011138916, 61.782246112823486], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.122147083282471], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.963389873504639], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [14.576261043548584]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1485, 3440], "completion": [229, 531], "total": [1714, 3971]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [107], "completion": [582], "total": [689]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [92], "completion": [655], "total": [747]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [72], "completion": [377], "total": [449]}}}

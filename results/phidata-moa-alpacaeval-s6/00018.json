The goal is to hit the shuttlecock over the net into your opponent's court such that they cannot return it.\n- **Rules:** A game begins with a serve. The server must serve diagonally from behind the service line. Only one hit per side is allowed before the shuttlecock must go over the net.\n- **Scoring System:** Games are played to 21 points, with a two-point lead required, usually in a best of three format.\n- **Gameplay Format:** Involves serving, rallies, and scoring through strategic shot placement. \n\n### Equipment for Badminton\n1. **Rackets:** Lightweight tools used to hit the shuttlecock, designed to offer a balance between control and power.\n2. **Shuttlecocks:** These feathered or synthetic projectiles must adhere to specific size and weight standards.\n3. **Net:** Central in the court, the height is key to fair play at 1.55 meters in the middle.\n4. **Court Layout:** A rectangular area with specific markings for singles and doubles play.\n5. Additional needs like proper footwear and breathable clothing enhance your playing comfort and efficiency.\n  \n### Basic Techniques and Skills\n1. **Grip Techniques:**\n   - **Forehand Grip:** Similar to shaking hands, used for forehand strokes.\n   - **Backhand Grip:** Uses thumb support, vital for backhand shots.\n   \n2. **Basic Shots:**\n   - **Serve (Short and Long):** Initiates the rally; short serves land close to the opponent's service line, and long ones push them back.\n   - **Clear, Drop Shot, Smash, and Drive:** Varying moves for different strategies, like clearing space or ending rallies.\n   \n3. **Footwork and Movement:**\n   - Practice shuffling and lunging for efficient court coverage.\n   \n4. **Positioning and Awareness:**\n   - Return to the center base after each shot to prepare for the opponent's return.\n\nThese fundamentals will help you build a strong foundation in badminton, guiding you through the initial stages of learning with a focus on enjoyment and skill development.

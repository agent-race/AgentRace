Wrap the thread underneath the button before tying off.\n6. **Tie off and trim**: Secure the thread with a knot on the underside, and neatly trim excess thread.\n7. **Test the button**: Ensure it\u2019s firmly attached and fits the buttonhole properly.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Tips for Secure and Neat Results**\n1. **Durable Thread**: Use polyester or nylon threads for strength.\n2. **Reinforcement for high-stress buttons**: Sew a small button or patch on the inside of the fabric to distribute stress and prevent damage.\n3. **Avoid tight stitches**: Keep slight slack in the stitches for ease when fastening buttons.\n4. **Mark your position**: Use a sewing marker or chalk to ensure precision in placement.\n\n---\n\n### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**\n1. **Using weak threads**: Thin threads may snap under pressure\u2014opt for durable materials.\n2. **Misalignment**: If buttons don't line up with buttonholes, they are functionally useless. Always check alignment before tightening stitches.\n3. **Rushing**: Uneven stitches or skipped steps can lead to loose buttons\u2014sew methodically.\n4. **Skipping the shank for thick fabrics**: Without a thread shank, buttons pull tightly against the fabric and risk breakage.\n5. **Using too few stitches**: Buttons with insufficient stitching often fall off; at least 6 stitches per hole are ideal.\n\n---\n\nBy following these instructions, adopting best practices, and avoiding mistakes, you can confidently sew a button on your shirt!

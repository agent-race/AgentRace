Here's a comprehensive version to make this traditional Georgian meat pie:\n\n## Kubdari Recipe\n\nKubdari, a delicious and spicy meat pie, originates from the Svaneti region of Georgia. It's filled with a mixture of savory meats and spices enclosed in a soft dough. Below are the guidelines for preparing and cooking this traditional dish.\n\n### Ingredients\n\n#### For the Dough:\n- 2-4 cups all-purpose flour\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n- 1/4 teaspoon sugar\n- 7g (1 packet) active dry yeast (optional, for a slightly leavened dough)\n- 1/2 to 1 cup warm water\n- 1/4 cup vegetable oil\n\n#### For the Filling:\n- 500g to 1 pound mixed minced meat (beef and pork preferred)\n- 1 large onion, finely chopped\n- 2-3 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n- 1 teaspoon ground coriander\n- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste)\n- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes (optional for heat)\n- Fresh herbs (cilantro and dill), chopped (approximately 2 tablespoons each)\n- Butter for greasing\n\n### Preparation Steps\n\n#### Dough Preparation:\n1. Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water and let it sit until frothy (if using yeast).\n2. In a large bowl, mix flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and oil.\n3. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 8-10 minutes. Cover and allow to rise for 1-1.5 hours until doubled in size.\n\n#### Filling Preparation:\n1. Combine the minced meats, chopped onion, garlic, spices, and herbs in a large bowl.\n2. Mix well to ensure even distribution of spices. Let the filling rest to allow flavors to meld.\n\n### Cooking Instructions\n\n#### Assembling the Kubdari:\n1. Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n2. Divide the dough into 4-6 portions. Roll each into a circle, about 1/8 inch thick.\n3. Place a portion of the filling in the center, gather the edges of the dough around the filling, and seal at the top.\n4. Flatten gently into a round pie shape and make slits to allow steam to escape.\n\n#### Cooking:\n1. Optionally start by cooking each pie in a greased skillet to achieve a golden-brown crust.\n2. Transfer to a baking sheet and bake in the oven for 25-35 minutes, ensuring the crust is golden and the meat is fully cooked.\n\n### Serving:\n- Brush with melted butter after baking.\n- Serve warm, traditionally with tkemali (sour plum sauce) or a simple side salad.\n\n### Tips:\n- Adjust spice levels to taste. Some variations include ajika for more heat.\n- Store leftover Kubdari in the refrigerator for up to 3 days; reheat before serving.\n\nEnjoy making and tasting this authentic Georgian dish!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 369, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 7783, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 369, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 7996, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 369, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 8605}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 3489, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 3591, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 3892}, "total_time": [60.78084087371826], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [4.527911901473999, 12.337832927703857], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.518492937088013], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.362318992614746], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [22.98948097229004]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1091, 3924], "completion": [275, 660], "total": [1366, 4584]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [122], "completion": [717], "total": [839]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [100], "completion": [771], "total": [871]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [91], "completion": [892], "total": [983]}}}

Below are the various factors that contribute to its high price.\n\n---\n\n### **Production Methods**\n1. **Selective Breeding**:\n   - Kobe beef comes exclusively from the Tajima-gyu strain of Japanese Black cattle, raised in the Hyogo prefecture of Japan.\n   - Only a small percentage of these cattle meet the requirements to be certified as Kobe beef.\n\n2. **Diet and Raising Practices**:\n   - Cattle are fed high-quality grains like soybeans and corn to enhance marbling.\n   - The animals are sometimes pampered with massages and stress-reduction techniques to optimize meat quality.\n\n3. **Time-Intensive Process**:\n   - Kobe cattle undergo a long feeding period (up to 600 days), which is labor-intensive and costly.\n\n---\n\n### **Rarity and Exclusivity**\n1. **Strict Certification Standards**:\n   - Kobe beef must meet rigorous standards set by the Kobe Beef Marketing & Distribution Promotion Association.\n   - Certification includes meeting Grade A4 or A5 (highest rankings) and high levels of marbling (shimofuri).\n\n2. **Geographical Indication**:\n   - All authentic Kobe beef must come from Hyogo prefecture, and exports are tightly controlled. Only about **3,000 head of cattle** earn this designation annually.\n\n3. **Traceability**: \n   - Every cut is traceable with a 10-digit ID to ensure authenticity, which adds to its prestige.\n\n---\n\n### **Exceptional Quality**\n1. **Marbling and Flavor**:\n   - Kobe beef is renowned for its high marble score, producing a rich, buttery texture and a unique umami flavor due to high oleic acid content.\n\n2. **Tenderness**:\n   - Stress-free environments and specialized farming practices ensure extraordinary tenderness, resulting in a melt-in-the-mouth texture.\n\n---\n\n### **Market Dynamics**\n1. **Global Demand vs. Limited Supply**:\n   - Only a limited number of Kobe beef cattle qualify for certification each year. This rarity creates high demand and premium pricing.\n   - Historically, exports were prohibited (until 2012), which added to its mystique.\n\n2. **Cultural Significance and Status**:\n   - Kobe beef is regarded as a pinnacle of Japanese culinary excellence, adding cultural prestige to its branding.\n\n3. **Import and Markup Costs**:\n   - Outside Japan, shipping, import duties, and restaurant markups further elevate its price.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nKobe beef's price reflects its rarity, high-quality production methods, unmatched marbling, strict certification, and the prestige associated with the product. In every sense, it is a luxury item, tailored for those seeking an indulgent culinary experience. Its exclusivity not only justifies the cost but also contributes to its desirability. \n\nLet me know if you'd like further details!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 257, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 7279, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 237, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 7158, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 261, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 5351}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 3293, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 3238, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2319}, "total_time": [93.0497579574585], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [3.5778989791870117, 57.51252317428589], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [8.676685810089111], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.9001638889312744], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [12.086182117462158]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1050, 2801], "completion": [203, 639], "total": [1253, 3440]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [100], "completion": [519], "total": [619]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [75], "completion": [540], "total": [615]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [69], "completion": [398], "total": [467]}}}

Housing Your Pet Rat**\nCreating a comfortable and safe environment is vital for your rat's well-being.\n\n- **Cage Requirements**:\n  - Minimum cage size is 24 x 12 x 12 inches, though larger is better to allow exploration.\n  - Use cages with bar spacing no wider than 1 inch to prevent escapes.\n  - Opt for wire cages over aquariums for better ventilation.\n\n- **Bedding and Accessories**:\n  - Choose safe bedding like aspen, fleece, or recycled paper. Avoid toxic options like pine or cedar shavings.\n  - Include accessories like hiding tunnels, chew toys, climbing structures, and food/water containers. Rotate toys for mental stimulation.\n\n- **Ventilation and Temperature**:\n  - Ensure good airflow to reduce ammonia buildup from rat urine.\n  - Maintain stable temperatures between 68\u201378\u00b0F (20\u201325\u00b0C). Keep the cage away from drafts or direct sunlight.\n\n- **Cleaning**:\n  - Spot-clean daily and do a full cage cleaning weekly with pet-safe disinfectants.\n  - Replace bedding and thoroughly clean all surfaces, especially around feeding areas.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Feeding Your Pet Rat**\nA well-balanced diet is essential for your rat's health.\n\n- **Primary Diet**:\n  - Use high-quality commercial rat food, like Oxbow or Purina Rodent Diet, as the base.\n\n- **Fruits and Vegetables**:\n  - Safe Fruits: Blueberries, bananas, apples (seedless), peaches, and strawberries.\n  - Safe Vegetables: Carrots, broccoli, spinach, green beans, and sweet potatoes.\n\n- **Grains and Proteins**:\n  - Grains: Oatmeal, brown rice, and quinoa are great carbohydrate sources.\n  - Proteins: Cooked chickens, eggs, tofu, or rat-specific protein treats.\n\n- **Foods to Avoid**:\n  - Toxic: Onion, garlic, avocado, chocolate, alcohol, raw meat.\n  - Limited: High-sugar foods (grapes, raisins), high-fat snacks (nuts, seeds), dairy products (rats are lactose intolerant).\n\n---\n\n### **3. General Care Tips**\n\n- **Socialization and Companionship**:\n  - Rats are social animals and thrive in pairs or groups; consider having two or more.\n  - Spend 1-2 hours daily interacting, including cuddling, playtime, or training.\n\n- **Health Monitoring**:\n  - Look for signs of illness: sneezing, lethargy, weight loss, labored breathing, or lumps.\n  - Schedule annual vet check-ups with an exotic vet and act promptly if symptoms occur.\n\n- **Enrichment**:\n  - Provide a large, multi-level cage with hideouts, chewable toys, and climbing opportunities.\n  - Allow at least 1-hour supervised free-roaming in a rat-proofed space daily.\n  - Introduce puzzle feeders or training techniques like clicker-based trick teaching.\n\n- **Stress and Illness**:\n  - Watch for behavioral changes like aggression, excessive hiding, reduced activity, or physical signs such as red discharge around the eyes/nose (porphyrin).\n  - Minimize loud noises and sudden changes in their environment to prevent stress.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Notes**\nRats are intelligent, affectionate companions that require daily attention, a stimulating environment, and proper healthcare.

Here are the key soil properties:\n\n1. **Excellent Drainage**:\n   - Cactus soil must allow water to drain quickly to prevent water retention, which can lead to root rot.\n   - Sandy or mineral-based soils with coarse texture are ideal for this purpose.\n\n2. **Porosity and Aeration**:\n   - A porous structure promotes airflow to the roots, ensuring healthy growth.\n   - Components like pumice or perlite improve aeration.\n\n3. **Low Organic Matter**:\n   - Soils with low levels of organic material prevent excessive water absorption.\n   - Organic matter (if used) should be minimal, like a small amount of well-rotted compost.\n\n4. **Low Water-Holding Capacity**:\n   - The soil should dry out quickly between watering sessions. Overly moist soils are harmful to cacti.\n\n5. **Slightly Acidic to Neutral pH**:\n   - Cacti prefer a pH in the range of 6.0 to 7.5. Adjusting pH with materials like limestone (if needed) can help.\n\n### **Recommended Soil Mixes for Cacti**\n\n1. **Homemade Cactus Soil Mix**:\n   - **3 parts coarse sand or perlite** (for drainage).\n   - **2 parts potting soil** (low-peat or cactus-specific).\n   - **1 part pumice or crushed stone**.\n\n2. **Grittier Mix (Desert Cacti)**:\n   - **1/3 coarse sand**.\n   - **1/3 perlite or pumice**.\n   - **1/3 potting soil** (slightly nutrient-rich).\n\n3. **Alternative Mix**:\n   - **40% cactus soil**.\n   - **30% perlite**.\n   - **20% crushed granite**.\n   - **10% pine bark fines** (optional for nutrients).\n\n### **What to Avoid**\n- **Heavy Garden Soil**: Too dense and retains moisture.\n- **Peat-Heavy Mixes**: These can retain water and are not ideal for dry conditions.\n\nBy ensuring your soil adheres to these guidelines, you can provide an optimal growing environment for cacti, promoting their health and minimizing risks associated with overwatering or poor drainage.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 268, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 5804, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 289, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 7142, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 261, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 4225}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2550, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 3204, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 1756}, "total_time": [35.264511823654175], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [4.873260021209717, 7.314547061920166], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.658109188079834], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.630539894104004], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [8.400230884552002]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1050, 2739], "completion": [214, 508], "total": [1264, 3247]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [102], "completion": [451], "total": [553]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [85], "completion": [577], "total": [662]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [72], "completion": [325], "total": [397]}}}

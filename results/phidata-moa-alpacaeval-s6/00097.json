What is Racquetball and How is it Played?**\n\n- **Objective**: Racquetball is an exciting indoor sport where players hit a hollow rubber ball against the front wall using a racquet. The main goal is to serve or return the ball in ways that your opponent cannot retrieve before the second bounce.\n\n- **Court Setup**: A racquetball court features four walls\u2014front, back, and two side walls. The court includes markings for the service zone and other boundaries essential to gameplay.\n\n- **Basic Rules**:\n    - **Serving**: Start in the service box, hitting the ball so it bounces past the service zone. Opponents try to return it.\n    - **Rallies**: Players alternate returning the ball until someone misses, hits it out of bounds, or commits an error.\n    - **Volleys**: Players may hit the ball before (volley) or after (groundstroke) it bounces once.\n    - **Scoring**: Matches are generally up to 11 points, and you must win by at least 2 points.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Equipment You\u2019ll Need:**\n\n- **Racquet**: Choose one with a larger head size (600\u2013650 sq. in.) for easier ball contact as a beginner.\n- **Ball**: Use a standard two-ounce rubber ball. Foam or slower balls may be easier for practice.\n- **Eyewear**: Protective goggles are essential for safety, as the ball moves quickly and can cause injury.\n- **Footwear**: Racquetball shoes with good grip help ensure stability and prevent damage to the court.\n- **Towel & Water Bottle**: Stay dry and hydrated during gameplay.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Tips for Beginners:**\n\n#### **Basic Techniques**:\n- **Grip**: Use a \"shake hands\" grip for solid control over the racquet.\n- **Stance**: Keep your knees slightly bent, and hold a balanced forward position.\n- **Swing**: Compact swings yield better accuracy and stronger shots.\n\n#### **Strategies**:\n- **Control the Center**: Always return to the middle of the court for the best shot coverage.\n- **Aim for Corners**: Shots toward the back corners are harder for your opponent to return.\n- **Practice Serves**: Consistent serves (lob or power serves) can give you a competitive advantage.\n\n#### **Safety**:\n- Always wear eye protection.\n- Stretch to warm up before matches and avoid muscle strains.\n- Be mindful of the opponent's position to avoid accidental collisions.\n\n---\n\nBy following these guidelines and tips, you\u2019ll be well-equipped to start learning and playing racquetball. The key is practice, patience, and having fun while you improve!

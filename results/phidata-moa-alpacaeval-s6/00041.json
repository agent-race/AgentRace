Potential Downsides**\n- **Cost**: Nannies can be expensive, especially when factoring in taxes, benefits, and other expenses.\n- **Privacy Concerns**: Having someone in your home can feel intrusive, and extra attention is needed to ensure confidentiality and security.\n- **Hiring Challenges**: Finding a trustworthy nanny that aligns with your family\u2019s values can be difficult and time-consuming.\n- **Attachment Issues for Kids**: Children may become deeply attached, and transitions (like a nanny leaving) could cause emotional stress.\n- **Legal Complexities**: There are labor laws and potential contractual obligations to manage when hiring a nanny.\n\n---\n\n### **3.

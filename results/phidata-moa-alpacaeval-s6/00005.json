Choose a chef's knife for general use or a paring knife for precision tasks.\n\n2. **Grip the Knife Properly:**\n   - Employ a **pinch grip**, where you hold the knife with your thumb and index finger on the blade and the rest of your fingers on the handle. This gives you better control.\n\n3. **Adopt the \"Claw\" Position:**\n   - Use your non-dominant hand to hold the food. Curl your fingertips inward so the knuckles act as a shield, keeping your fingers safe from the blade.\n\n4. **Make Controlled Cuts:**\n   - Slice slowly and with a stable, deliberate motion. Begin with parallel cuts, followed by perpendicular cuts to achieve the dice shape.\n\n5. **Position the Food Securely:**\n   - Always place the flat side of the food against the cutting board to provide stability.\n\n---\n\n### **Safety Tips and Tools**\n\n1. **Non-Slip Cutting Board:**\n   - Use a damp cloth or anti-slip mat beneath your cutting board to prevent movement.\n\n2. **Protective Gear:**\n   - Consider using **cut-resistant gloves** or **finger guards** for added safety.\n\n3. **Auxiliary Tools:**\n   - Use food choppers, mandoline slicers (with hand guards), or vegetable dicers as alternatives to a knife.\n\n---\n\n### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**\n- **Rushing Through the Task:** Always pay attention while cutting to avoid accidents.\n- **Applying Too Much Pressure:** Let the sharpness of the knife do the work.\n- **Holding Loose Ingredients:** Ensure your grip is secure, but avoid having your fingers in the blade's path.\n\n---\n\nBy following these steps and using the recommended tools, you can dice ingredients safely and confidently.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 268, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 7624, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 266, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 5285, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 255, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 5685}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 3460, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2287, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2489}, "total_time": [50.352712869644165], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [2.9747378826141357, 18.705578804016113], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.158782958984375], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [2.8366141319274902], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [12.824934005737305]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1049, 2860], "completion": [210, 416], "total": [1259, 3276]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [102], "completion": [639], "total": [741]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [79], "completion": [366], "total": [445]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [67], "completion": [454], "total": [521]}}}

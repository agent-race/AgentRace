It is created through a process known as **condensation polymerization**, which involves the reaction of two key monomers:\n\n1. **Para-phenylenediamine (PPD)**\n2. **Terephthaloyl chloride (TPC)**\n\nThese react to form strong **amide bonds (-CONH-)** in the polymer, releasing hydrogen chloride (HCl) as a byproduct.\n\n---\n\n### Chemical Structure and Features:\n- The polymer chains in Kevlar are highly **oriented and crystalline**.\n- Strong **intermolecular hydrogen bonds** firmly hold the polymer chains together.\n- The structural arrangement, along with the aromatic backbone, provides **exceptional thermal, chemical, and mechanical resistance**.\n\n---\n\n### Key Properties:\n- **Strength:** Kevlar is up to five times stronger than steel by weight.\n- **Lightweight:** Its low density makes it ideal for aerospace, military, and other applications.\n- **Heat Resistance:** High melting point (~370\u00b0C) and can withstand prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures.\n- **Chemical Resistance:** Resistant to many acids, bases, and solvents.\n- **Durability:** Flexible yet robust, ensuring long-term performance in critical uses.\n\n### Applications:\nKevlar is widely used in **bulletproof vests**, **industrial cables**, **tyres**, **fireproof equipment**, and other applications that demand strength, light weight, and durability.\n\nIf you'd like further details on a particular aspect of Kevlar, feel free to ask!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 256, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2798, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 247, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 8256, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 229, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 3445}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 0, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 1053, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 0, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 3782, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 0, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 1382}, "total_time": [38.16066098213196], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [3.284497022628784, 6.087835073471069], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [6.991790056228638], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [9.351111888885498], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [3.0889358520507812]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1049, 2292], "completion": [196, 360], "total": [1245, 2652]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [103], "completion": [107], "total": [210]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [78], "completion": [732], "total": [810]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [62], "completion": [160], "total": [222]}}}

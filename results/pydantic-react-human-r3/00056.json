A balanced string ensures that no closing bracket (\">\") appears before an opening bracket (\"<\").\n\nHere's how to implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef correct_bracketing(brackets: str):\n    \"\"\" \n    brackets is a string of \"<\" and \">\".\n    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.\n\n    >>> correct_bracketing(\"<\")\n    False\n    >>> correct_bracketing(\"<>\")\n    True\n    >>> correct_bracketing(\"<<><>>\")\n    True\n    >>> correct_bracketing(\"><<>\")\n    False\n    \"\"\"\n    balance = 0\n    for char in brackets:\n        if char == \"<\":\n            balance += 1\n        elif char == \">\":\n            balance -= 1\n        # If balance goes negative, there's a \">\" without a corresponding \"<\"\n        if balance < 0:\n            return False\n    # At the end, balance must be zero for the brackets to be correct\n    return balance == 0\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. Use a variable `balance` to keep count. Increment it for every opening bracket (\"<\") and decrement for every closing bracket (\">\").\n2. If at any point `balance` becomes negative, that means there are unmatched closing brackets, and the function immediately returns `False`.\n3. Once the loop finishes, check if `balance` is `0`. If it is, the brackets are correctly paired; otherwise, they are not.\n\nThis function adheres to the requirements described in the examples.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [9.967622995376587], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [9.951342105865479]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [756], "completion": [355], "total": [1111]}}}

If all elements are in a non-decreasing order, we'll return `-1`.\n\nHere's an implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef can_arrange(arr):\n    # Traverse the array\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        # Check if current element is smaller than the previous one\n        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:\n            return i\n    # Return -1 if no such element is found\n    return -1\n\n# Examples\nprint(can_arrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5]))  # Output: 3\nprint(can_arrange([1, 2, 3]))        # Output: -1\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We loop through the list starting from the second element (index 1) because we need to compare each element to its predecessor.\n- The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is used to check where the sequence breaks its non-decreasing order.\n- If such a break is found, we return the index of that element.\n- If no such elements are found, the function returns `-1`, indicating the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [5.239929914474487], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.226362943649292]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [766], "completion": [288], "total": [1054]}}}

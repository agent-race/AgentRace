{"query": "\ndef hex_key(num):\n    \"\"\"You have been tasked to write a function that receives \n    a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal \n    digits that are primes (prime number, or a prime, is a natural number \n    greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers).\n    Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.\n    Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...\n    So you have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, \n    B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13).\n    Note: you may assume the input is always correct or empty string, \n    and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.\n    Examples:\n    For num = \"AB\" the output should be 1.\n    For num = \"1077E\" the output should be 2.\n    For num = \"ABED1A33\" the output should be 4.\n    For num = \"123456789ABCDEF0\" the output should be 6.\n    For num = \"2020\" the output should be 2.\n    \"\"\"", "answer": "    primes = ('2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D')\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(0, len(num)):\n        if num[i] in primes:\n            total += 1\n    return total", "result": "Here's the implementation of the function `hex_key` which fulfills the requirements stated in the problem description:\n\n```python\ndef hex_key(num):\n    \"\"\"Counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes.\"\"\"\n    # Define the set of hexadecimal digits that correspond to prime numbers\n    prime_hex_digits = {'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'}\n    \n    # Count the number of prime digits in the input string\n    return sum(1 for digit in num if digit in prime_hex_digits)\n\n# Examples\nprint(hex_key(\"AB\"))             # Output: 1\nprint(hex_key(\"1077E\"))          # Output: 2\nprint(hex_key(\"ABED1A33\"))       # Output: 4\nprint(hex_key(\"123456789ABCDEF0\"))  # Output: 6\nprint(hex_key(\"2020\"))           # Output: 2\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Prime Hexadecimal Digits**:\n   The prime hexadecimal digits are `{2, 3, 5, 7, B (11), D (13)}`. These are represented as a set of characters for efficient lookup.\n\n2. **Input Parsing**:\n   It is assumed that the input string is given and valid (i.e., it contains only hexadecimal digits, with `A-F` in uppercase).\n\n3. **Counting Primes**:\n   A generator expression is used to iterate through each character in the input string and check if it belongs to the set of prime hexadecimal digits. The `sum` function counts how many such characters exist.\n\nFeel free to test this implementation with any valid hexadecimal input!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [8.963807106018066], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [8.945367813110352]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [962], "completion": [341], "total": [1303]}}}

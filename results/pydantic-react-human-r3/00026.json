A list comprehension is used to iterate through the numbers in the original order, keeping only those numbers that have a count of `1` in the `Counter`.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```python\nprint(remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])) \n# Output: [1, 3, 4]\n```", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [8.266200065612793], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [8.248657941818237]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [746], "completion": [227], "total": [973]}}}

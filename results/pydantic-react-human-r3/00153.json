The strength is calculated using the formula provided: \\( \\text{strength} = \\text{CAP} - \\text{SM} \\), where CAP is the count of uppercase letters and SM is the count of lowercase letters in the extension name.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):\n    max_strength = None\n    strongest_extension = None\n\n    for extension in extensions:\n        cap_count = sum(1 for c in extension if c.isupper())\n        sm_count = sum(1 for c in extension if c.islower())\n        strength = cap_count - sm_count\n\n        if (max_strength is None) or (strength > max_strength):\n            max_strength = strength\n            strongest_extension = extension\n\n    return f\"{class_name}.{strongest_extension}\"\n\n# Example Usage:\nprint(Strongest_Extension('Slices', ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed']))  # Output: 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes'\nprint(Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']))  # Output: 'my_class.AA'\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Loop** through each extension in the `extensions` list.\n2. **Calculate the strength** by counting the number of uppercase and lowercase letters and apply the formula \\( \\text{CAP} - \\text{SM} \\).\n3. **Track the maximum strength**: Update the `max_strength` and `strongest_extension` whenever a new highest strength is found.\n4. **Return** the formatted string combining the class name and the strongest extension.\n\nThe function will return the strongest extension name combined with the class name. If there are multiple extensions with the same strength, the one that appears first in the list is chosen, as per the problem's requirements.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [5.522909879684448], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.503306865692139]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [935], "completion": [418], "total": [1353]}}}

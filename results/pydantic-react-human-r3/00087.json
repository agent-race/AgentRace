If so, append its coordinate `(row_index, col_index)` to the result list.\n3. **Sorting:** After collecting all the coordinates, sort them by row in ascending order, and within the same row, sort by columns in descending order. This is achieved by using a custom sort key `(row_index, -col_index)`.\n4. **Return result:** The sorted list of coordinates is then returned.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [15.107462882995605], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [15.091552972793579]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [922], "completion": [515], "total": [1437]}}}

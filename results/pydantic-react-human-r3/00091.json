The condition `sentence == \"I\"` additionally ensures that we count the single-letter sentence `\"I\"`.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [13.597917079925537], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [13.581739902496338]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [770], "completion": [376], "total": [1146]}}}

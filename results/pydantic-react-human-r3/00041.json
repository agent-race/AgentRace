{"query": "\n\ndef car_race_collision(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.\n    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars\n    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from\n    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide\n    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.\n    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving\n    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.\n\n    This function outputs the number of such collisions.\n    \"\"\"", "answer": "    return n**2", "result": "In this scenario, given the setup, no actual \"collisions\" happen in the sense of cars stopping or changing behavior. The function, however, refers to the theoretical number of \"interactions\" or crossing paths where cars traveling in opposite directions would meet.\n\nHere's an explanation of the situation:\n\n1. There are `n` cars moving left to right.\n2. Similarly, there are `n` cars moving right to left.\n3. Both sets of cars move at the same speed.\n4. Since cars going in opposite directions are infinitely sturdy and unaffected by collisions, we only care about the number of crossings between the two groups.\n\nThe number of pairwise crossings is simple to compute. Each car moving left to right will theoretically \"collide\" with every car moving right to left. Thus, the total number of crossings can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total \"collisions\"} = n \\times n = n^2\n\\]\n\nFor instance:\n\n- If `n = 1`, there is 1 \"collision\" (1 car in each direction interacts).\n- If `n = 2`, there are \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\) crossings.\n- If `n = 3`, there are \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\) crossings.\n\nThus, for a given input value of `n`, the number of \"collisions\" is equal to \\( n^2 \\). \n\nHere\u2019s the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the number of theoretical collisions between two sets of n cars\n    moving in opposite directions on an infinitely long straight road.\n    \n    Args:\n    - n (int): The number of cars moving in each direction.\n    \n    Returns:\n    - int: The total number of collisions.\n    \"\"\"\n    return n ** 2\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nprint(car_race_collision(3))  # Output: 9\n```", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [8.133403062820435], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [8.109832048416138]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [812], "completion": [409], "total": [1221]}}}

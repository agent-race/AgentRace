Returns decoded string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.\n    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]\n    # cycle elements back to original position in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.\n    groups = [(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]\n    return \"\".join(groups)\n\n```\n\nThis function splits the input into groups of three, and for each complete group, it cycles the characters back to their original positions by moving the last character to the front. If a group contains fewer than three characters, it remains unchanged.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [3.337637186050415], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [3.320441961288452]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [822], "completion": [262], "total": [1084]}}}

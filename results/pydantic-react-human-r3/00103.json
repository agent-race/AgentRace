If so, return `-1` as specified.\n\n2. **Sum and Count**:\n   Calculate the sum of integers from `n` to `m` (`sum(range(n, m + 1))`) and the count of numbers `(m - n + 1)`.\n\n3. **Average**:\n   Compute the average by dividing the sum by the count and use Python's `round()` function to round it to the nearest integer.\n\n4. **Binary Conversion**:\n   Convert the rounded average to its binary representation using Python's `bin()` function.\n\n5. **Return**:\n   Return the binary string representation of the value if it is valid, or `-1` if the condition is not met.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [13.858347177505493], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [13.842529058456421]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [803], "completion": [385], "total": [1188]}}}

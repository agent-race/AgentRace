If the length is prime, we will include the word in the result. Finally, we'll return the words with prime lengths as a single string.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to determine if a number n is a prime.\"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef words_in_sentence(sentence):\n    words = sentence.split()\n    prime_length_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]\n    return ' '.join(prime_length_words)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(words_in_sentence(\"This is a test\"))  # Output: \"is\"\nprint(words_in_sentence(\"lets go for swimming\"))  # Output: \"go for\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **`is_prime` Function:** This helper function checks if a given number is prime. It first handles numbers less than or equal to 3 separately, as they have distinct prime properties. Then it uses a loop with optimizations to check divisibility, making it more efficient for larger numbers.\n\n2. **`words_in_sentence` Function:**\n   - **Split Sentence:** The sentence is split into words.\n   - **Filter Words:** A list comprehension is used to filter words where the length is a prime number.\n   - **Join and Return:** The selected words are joined back into a string with spaces and returned.\n\nThis solution efficiently determines which words have prime lengths and returns them in the correct order.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [5.564028024673462], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.54892897605896]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [810], "completion": [425], "total": [1235]}}}

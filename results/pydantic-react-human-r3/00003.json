We initialize a variable `balance` to `0` to track the current account balance.\n2. For each operation in the `operations` list, we add the value of the operation to the `balance`.\n3. If at any point `balance` falls below `0`, the function immediately returns `True`.\n4. If the loop completes and the balance never went below zero, the function returns `False`.\n\nThis implementation efficiently determines whether the balance falls below zero for the given list of operations.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [4.192994832992554], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [4.176518201828003]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [780], "completion": [267], "total": [1047]}}}

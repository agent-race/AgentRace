Words and spaces are handled in sequence.\n4. **Final check:** The last word is processed after the loop, in case the string doesn't end with a space.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to explain further!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [21.96994113922119], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [21.951153993606567]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [791], "completion": [352], "total": [1143]}}}

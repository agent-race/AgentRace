For example, `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]` represents the polynomial \\(3 + 1x + 2x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4\\).\n- The `range(1, len(xs))` skips zero (constant term does not contribute to the derivative) and iterates over indices 1 to `len(xs) - 1`.\n- For each coefficient `xs[i]`, it is multiplied by its power `i` to compute the derivative term.\n- The result is a new list of coefficients representing the derivative of the polynomial.\n\n### Example usage:\n```python\nprint(derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]))  # Output: [1, 4, 12, 20]\nprint(derivative([1, 2, 3]))        # Output: [2, 6]\n```", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [8.73412299156189], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [8.718382120132446]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [770], "completion": [379], "total": [1149]}}}

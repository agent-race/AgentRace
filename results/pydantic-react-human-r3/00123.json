A `set` named `odd_numbers` is used to collect all odd numbers to avoid duplicates automatically.\n2. **Collatz Sequence**: A `while` loop continues processing `n` until it reaches `1`. Inside the loop:\n   - Check if `n` is odd (`n % 2 == 1`). If so, add it to the `odd_numbers` set.\n   - Update `n` according to the Collatz rules: if `n` is even, divide it by 2; if odd, calculate `3 * n + 1`.\n3. **Final Step**: Add `1` to the set of odd numbers (since every sequence ends at `1` by definition).\n4. **Sorted Output**: Convert the `set` of odd numbers into a sorted list before returning.\n\nThis implementation ensures correctness, manages duplicates efficiently, and satisfies all requirements stated in the problem.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [19.730925798416138], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [19.714417934417725]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [896], "completion": [575], "total": [1471]}}}

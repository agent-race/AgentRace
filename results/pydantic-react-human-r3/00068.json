Iterate through the array while keeping track of the smallest even value and its index.\n3. If multiple indices have the same smallest even value, the index that appears first will be chosen (handled through a simple comparison of values during iteration).\n4. If no even numbers are found, return an empty list.\n\nThis function processes the input array in \\(O(n)\\), complying with the constraints \\(1 \\leq \\text{nodes.length} \\leq 10,000\\).", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [8.077330827713013], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [8.061773777008057]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [975], "completion": [413], "total": [1388]}}}

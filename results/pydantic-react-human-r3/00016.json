Let me provide an explanation of how this function might work, along with its implementation:\n\n```python\ndef count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\" \n    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of.\n    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')\n    3\n    >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')\n    4\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the string to lowercase to make the counting case-insensitive\n    lowercase_string = string.lower()\n    \n    # Use a set to store distinct characters\n    distinct_characters = set(lowercase_string)\n    \n    # Return the size of the set, which represents the count of distinct characters\n    return len(distinct_characters)\n```\n\n### How It Works:\n1. **Converting to Lowercase:** The string is converted to lowercase using `.lower()`. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive (e.g., `'x'` and `'X'` will be treated as the same character).\n2. **Using a Set for Distinctness:** A `set` is used because sets inherently store only unique elements.\n3. **Counting the Distinct Characters:** The `len()` function is applied to the set to count the number of unique elements, which corresponds to the number of distinct characters in the string.\n\n### Examples:\n1. `count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')`:\n   - Lowercased: `'xyzxyz'`\n   - Unique characters: `{'x', 'y', 'z'}`\n   - Result: `3`\n2. `count_distinct_characters('Jerry')`:\n   - Lowercased: `'jerry'`\n   - Unique characters: `{'j', 'e', 'r', 'y'}`\n   - Result: `4`\n\nYou can use this function in any Python script, and it will behave as described above.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [6.182823896408081], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [6.166650056838989]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [736], "completion": [427], "total": [1163]}}}

Here's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:\n    factors = []\n    # Start with the smallest prime number\n    divisor = 2\n    while n > 1:\n        while n % divisor == 0:\n            factors.append(divisor)\n            n //= divisor\n        divisor += 1\n    return factors\n```\n\nThis code uses a `while` loop to test each number starting from 2 to see if it's a divisor of `n`. If it is, it's repeatedly added to the factors list, and `n` is divided by this number until it can no longer be divided. Then the next potential divisor is tested. This continues until `n` is reduced to 1.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [3.0645270347595215], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [3.0475399494171143]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [788], "completion": [195], "total": [983]}}}

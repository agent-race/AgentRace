If the method converges to a value such that the polynomial's value is within a specified tolerance of zero, it returns the \\( x \\)-value.\n\nThis implementation assumes the following for convergence:\n- A reasonable initial guess (`initial_guess`).\n- The function is differentiable at the initial guess and during iterations.\n- Failure to converge raises exceptions for zero derivative or reaching maximum iterations. \n\nYou can now use these functions for finding zeros of polynomials with the conditions you've stated.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [5.915054082870483], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.8932459354400635]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [922], "completion": [529], "total": [1451]}}}

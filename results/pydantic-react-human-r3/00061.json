We initialize a variable `balance` to 0.\n2. For every opening bracket `\"(\"`, we increment `balance` by 1.\n3. For every closing bracket `\")\"`, we decrement `balance` by 1.\n4. If `balance` becomes negative at any point, it means there are unmatched closing brackets, so we return `False`.\n5. Finally, if `balance` is 0 after processing all characters, it means the brackets are correctly matched. Otherwise, the brackets string is invalid.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [5.767854928970337], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.750881910324097]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [754], "completion": [305], "total": [1059]}}}

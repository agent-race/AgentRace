The rules for determining the number of stones in each level are as follows:\n\n1. The first level has \\( n \\) stones.\n2. If \\( n \\) is odd, then each subsequent level has the next odd number of stones.\n3. If \\( n \\) is even, then each subsequent level has the next even number of stones.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `make_a_pile` function:\n\n```python\ndef make_a_pile(n):\n    pile = [n]\n    current_stones = n\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if n % 2 == 1:  # n is odd\n            current_stones += 2  # Increment by next odd number\n        else:  # n is even\n            current_stones += 2  # Increment by next even number\n        pile.append(current_stones)\n    \n    return pile\n\n# Examples\nprint(make_a_pile(3))  # Output: [3, 5, 7]\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- Start with the first level having \\( n \\) stones.\n- Iterate over the remaining levels, updating the stone count by adding 2 to the previous level's stone count.\n- Append the stone count for each level to the pile list.\n- Return the list representing the number of stones in each level. \n\nThe code should work as expected and produce the output outlined in the docstring example.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [7.785161018371582], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.773052930831909]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [795], "completion": [320], "total": [1115]}}}

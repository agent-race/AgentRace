If no even number exists within the range, it will return -1.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [7.689726114273071], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.673323154449463]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [756], "completion": [269], "total": [1025]}}}

Below, I'll provide code to address the problem:\n\n```python\ndef is_equal_to_sum_even(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.\n\n    Parameters:\n    n (int): The input number.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A positive even number must be greater than 0 and divisible by 2\n    # For 4 positive even numbers, we need at least 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8\n    if n < 8:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check whether the number n is even, because only even numbers\n    # can be the sum of even numbers\n    return n % 2 == 0\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(is_equal_to_sum_even(4))  # Output: False\nprint(is_equal_to_sum_even(6))  # Output: False\nprint(is_equal_to_sum_even(8))  # Output: True\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. The function first checks whether `n` is below 8. The smallest sum of four positive even numbers is \\(2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8\\), so any number less than 8 cannot qualify.\n2. Additionally, the function checks whether `n` is an even number. A number `n` can only be written as the sum of even numbers if it is itself even.\n3. If both conditions are satisfied, `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.\n\n### Test Cases:\n- **For `n = 4`**: Output is `False`, since \\(4 < 8\\).\n- **For `n = 6`**: Output is `False`, since \\(6 < 8\\).\n- **For `n = 8`**: Output is `True`, since \\(8 \\geq 8\\) and it is even.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [5.2357988357543945], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.214554071426392]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [740], "completion": [459], "total": [1199]}}}

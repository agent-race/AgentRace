Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:\n    # Split the input string into individual notes\n    notes = music_string.split()\n    \n    # Map each note to its corresponding beat value\n    note_to_beat = {\n        'o': 4,    # whole note\n        'o|': 2,   # half note\n        '.|': 1    # quarter note\n    }\n    \n    # Create a list to store beat values for each note\n    beats = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each note and map it to its beat value using the dictionary\n    for note in notes:\n        if note in note_to_beat:\n            beats.append(note_to_beat[note])\n    \n    return beats\n\n# Example usage\nprint(parse_music('o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o'))  # Output: [4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Splitting the String:** The string is split into individual note components using `.split()`, which assumes notes are separated by spaces.\n2. **Mapping Notes to Beats:** A dictionary `note_to_beat` is created, mapping each note symbol to its beat duration.\n3. **Translating Notes:** The function iterates over each note in the split list, looks up its beat value in the dictionary, and appends the result to the `beats` list.\n4. **Return the Beat List:** The resulting list of integers, each representing the duration of a note, is returned.\n\nBy following this approach, the function is able to correctly parse a given string of music notes into their corresponding beat durations.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [6.2807581424713135], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [6.259210109710693]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [832], "completion": [438], "total": [1270]}}}

Start dividing \\( n \\) by the smallest prime (2) and continue dividing until \\( n \\) is no longer divisible by 2.\n2. For odd factors \\( d \\), increment \\( d \\) from 3 and check if \\( n \\) is divisible by \\( d \\). If so, continue dividing.\n3. Stop when \\( d^2 \\) (the square of \\( d \\)) becomes greater than \\( n \\). If \\( n > 1 \\) at the end, then \\( n \\) itself is a prime factor.\n\nHere's the Python code that implements the steps:\n\n```python\ndef largest_prime_factor(n: int):\n    \"\"\"Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime.\"\"\"\n    factor = 2\n    while n % factor == 0:  # Divide by 2 until n is odd\n        n //= factor\n    factor = 3\n    while factor * factor <= n:  # Test odd factors from 3 up\n        if n % factor == 0:\n            n //= factor\n        else:\n            factor += 2\n    return max(factor, n)  # The larger between 'factor' and remaining 'n'\n\n# Test cases\nprint(largest_prime_factor(13195))  # Should return 29\nprint(largest_prime_factor(2048))   # Should return 2\n```\n\nThis code ensures that the largest prime factor is returned efficiently. The function uses a divide-and-conquer approach to systematically reduce \\( n \\) until only the largest prime factor remains.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [4.929366111755371], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [4.912798166275024]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [726], "completion": [354], "total": [1080]}}}

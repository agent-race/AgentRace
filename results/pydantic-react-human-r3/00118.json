Here is how you can implement it:\n\n```python\ndef get_closest_vowel(word):\n    vowels = 'AEIOUaeiou'\n    length = len(word)\n\n    # Start from the second to last character and move left\n    for i in range(length - 2, 0, -1):\n        # Check if the character is a vowel and is surrounded by consonants\n        if word[i] in vowels and word[i-1] not in vowels and word[i+1] not in vowels:\n            return word[i]\n    \n    return \"\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We start checking the word from the second to last character, because we need a vowel between two consonants.\n- We iterate backwards until we reach the second character.\n- For each character, we check if it is a vowel and whether it is surrounded on both sides by consonants.\n- If a valid vowel is found, we return it immediately.\n- If no such vowel is found after checking all possible positions, we return an empty string. \n\nThis approach ensures that the vowel is not at the very beginning or end of the string and is properly nestled between consonants.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [4.454413890838623], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [4.438777923583984]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [809], "completion": [289], "total": [1098]}}}

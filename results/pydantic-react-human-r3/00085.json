Let's walk through the process:\n\n1. Iterate over each element in the list along with its index.\n2. Check if the index is odd.\n3. If yes, check if the element is even.\n4. If both conditions are true, add the element to a running total.\n5. Return the total after the loop.\n\nHere's a Python function to do that:\n\n```python\ndef add(lst):\n    total = 0\n    for index, value in enumerate(lst):\n        if index % 2 != 0 and value % 2 == 0:  # Index is odd, value is even\n            total += value\n    return total\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(add([4, 2, 6, 7]))  # Output: 2\n```\n\nThis function will iterate over the list and check each index and value, summing the even numbers located at odd indices.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [10.397836923599243], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [10.381276845932007]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [718], "completion": [210], "total": [928]}}}

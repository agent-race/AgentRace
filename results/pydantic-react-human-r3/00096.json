Initialize an empty list to store the prime numbers.\n2. Loop through numbers starting from 2 up to `n` (exclusive of `n`).\n3. For each number, check if it is a prime:\n   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.\n   - To check if a number is prime, you can try dividing it by every number between 2 and the square root of that number. If it is not divisible by any of those numbers, it's a prime.\n4. If a number is prime, add it to the list.\n5. Return the list of prime numbers.\n\nHere's a Python implementation for the same:\n\n```python\ndef count_up_to(n):\n    def is_prime(num):\n        if num <= 1:\n            return False\n        for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):\n            if num % i == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n    \n    primes = []\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        if is_prime(i):\n            primes.append(i)\n    \n    return primes\n\n# Test cases\nprint(count_up_to(5))  # Output: [2, 3]\nprint(count_up_to(11))  # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7]\nprint(count_up_to(0))  # Output: []\nprint(count_up_to(20))  # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]\nprint(count_up_to(1))  # Output: []\nprint(count_up_to(18))  # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]\n```\n\nThese steps and code should provide a correct solution to the specified problem.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [5.458111047744751], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.440716981887817]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [808], "completion": [409], "total": [1217]}}}

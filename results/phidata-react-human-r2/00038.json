Specifically, you'll uncycle each group of three characters in the encoded string back to its original order.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `decode_cyclic` function:\n\n```python\ndef decode_cyclic(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # split string into groups of three characters, as was done during encoding\n    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]\n    # reverse the cycle in each group, unless the group contains fewer than three elements\n    groups = [(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]\n    return \"\".join(groups)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Splitting into Groups**: The string is divided into groups of three characters, as was done during encoding.\n\n2. **Decoding Each Group**: Each group of three characters is uncycled by moving the last character to the beginning of the group.\n\n3. **Handling Groups with Less Than Three Characters**: Groups with fewer than three characters are left unchanged, similar to the encoding process.\n\nNow, you can use `decode_cyclic` to decode strings that were encoded with `encode_cyclic`.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [8.221930027008057], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [4.824068069458008]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [990], "completion": [309], "total": [1299]}}}

Each occurrence is represented as a tuple of coordinates `(row, column)`, where indices start from 0. The coordinates are sorted in the following way:\n1. Rows are sorted in ascending order.\n2. For each row, columns are sorted in descending order.\n\nHere's how to implement the `get_row` function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef get_row(lst, x):\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each row with its index\n    for row_index, row in enumerate(lst):\n        # Iterate over each element in the row with its index\n        for col_index, value in enumerate(row):\n            if value == x:\n                result.append((row_index, col_index))\n    \n    # Sort results by rows in ascending order\n    # and columns in descending order within the row\n    result.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))\n    \n    return result\n\n# Examples\nprint(get_row([\n    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],\n    [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6],\n    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]\n], 1))  # Output: [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]\n\nprint(get_row([], 1))  # Output: []\nprint(get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3))  # Output: [(2, 2)]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Iterate through rows and columns**: Traverse the nested list `lst` using a nested loop.\n   - The outer loop iterates over rows and their indices.\n   - The inner loop iterates over elements in each row along with their indices.\n\n2. **Check for occurrences of `x`**: If an element in a row matches `x`, append its coordinates `(row_index, col_index)` to the `result` list.\n\n3. **Sort the result**:\n   - The primary key is the row index `row`, sorted in ascending order.\n   - The secondary key is the negative of the column index `-column`, sorted in descending order.\n\n4. **Return the sorted list of coordinates**. \n\nThis function meets the requirements stated in the prompt.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [10.130497932434082], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [8.379199028015137]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1090], "completion": [517], "total": [1607]}}}

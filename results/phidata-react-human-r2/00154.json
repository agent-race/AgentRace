{"query": "\ndef compare(game,guess):\n    \"\"\"I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited\n    event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are\n    definitely worth noting down and comparing.\n    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.\n    You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. \n    Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,\n    the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\n    \n    \n    example:\n\n    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]\n    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]\n    \"\"\"", "answer": "    return [abs(x-y) for x,y in zip(game,guess)]", "result": "The task requires writing a Python function to compare two lists: `game` (the actual scores) and `guess` (guesses). For each index, calculate `0` if the guess is correct; otherwise, calculate the absolute difference between the `game` element and the `guess` element. Here's the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef compare(game, guess):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines how far off each guess is from the actual scores.\n    \n    Arguments:\n    game -- list of actual scores\n    guess -- list of guessed scores\n    \n    Returns:\n    A list of absolute differences between the actual scores and the guesses.\n    If the guess matches the score, the difference is 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [abs(g - s) if g != s else 0 for g, s in zip(game, guess)]\n\n# Examples:\nprint(compare([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2]))  # Output [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]\nprint(compare([0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4], [4, 1, 1, 0, 0, -2]))  # Output [4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 6]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function uses a list comprehension with `zip` to iterate over both lists (`game` and `guess`) simultaneously.\n- For each pair `(g, s)` of score (`g`) and guess (`s`), it calculates:\n  - `0` if `g == s` (correct guess).\n  - `abs(g - s)` if `g != s` (incorrect guess).\n  \nThis ensures that the resulting list contains the desired values at each index.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [11.038357019424438], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [6.310812950134277]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1061], "completion": [391], "total": [1452]}}}

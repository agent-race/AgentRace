Especially for larger indices, the recursion can be expensive if not optimized. To create the `tri(n)` function that returns the list of the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence, we can use memoization or caching to save the results of sub-problems.\n\nHere is the Python implementation for the described Tribonacci sequence:\n\n```python\ndef tri(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a list of the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.\"\"\"\n    # Using a dictionary for memoization of results\n    tribonacci = {}\n\n    def compute_tribonacci(k):\n        if k not in tribonacci:\n            if k == 0:\n                tribonacci[k] = 1\n            elif k == 1:\n                tribonacci[k] = 3\n            elif k % 2 == 0:  # k is even\n                tribonacci[k] = 1 + k // 2\n            else:  # k is odd\n                # Recursively compute for k - 1, k - 2, k + 1\n                tribonacci[k] = compute_tribonacci(k - 1) + compute_tribonacci(k - 2) + compute_tribonacci(k + 1)\n        return tribonacci[k]\n\n    # Compute tribonacci values for all indices from 0 to n\n    result = []\n    for i in range(n + 1):\n        result.append(compute_tribonacci(i))\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nprint(tri(3))  # Output: [1, 3, 2, 8]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Memoization**:\n   - We store computed values in the `tribonacci` dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.\n   - If the result for an index \\(k\\) is not already calculated, we calculate it and store it.\n\n2. **Recursive Handling**:\n   - For even values of \\(k\\), we directly compute \\(1 + k / 2\\).\n   - For odd values of \\(k\\), we use the recursive formula: `tri(k) = tri(k-1) + tri(k-2) + tri(k+1)`.\n\n3. **Result Population**:\n   - We iterate from 0 to \\(n\\), populating the Tribonacci values for all indices in a list.\n\nThis approach handles the computation efficiently by storing intermediate results, avoiding excessive recursion.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [11.631789207458496], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [8.315356969833374]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1065], "completion": [522], "total": [1587]}}}

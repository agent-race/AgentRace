The function will count the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13.\n\nHere's a detailed plan for the function:\n\n1. Initialize a counter to zero.\n2. Loop through all integers from 0 to `n-1`.\n3. Check if the number is divisible by either 11 or 13.\n4. If it is, check if the digit '7' is in the string representation of the number.\n5. If the digit '7' is found, increment the counter.\n6. Return the counter at the end.\n\nNow, I'll implement the function.\nRunning:\n - run_python_code(code=..., variable_to_return=fizz_buzz(50), fizz_buzz(78), fizz_buzz(79))\n\nIt seems there is an issue with retrieving the results. Let me re-run the code and return the individual values for the test cases as separate variables instead.\nRunning:\n - run_python_code(code=..., variable_to_return=result_1, result_2, result_3)\n\nIt seems I encountered an issue while executing the code and retrieving the results. I\u2019ll attempt to debug the implementation to ensure the results for the test cases are calculated correctly. Let me proceed again to resolve this.\nRunning:\n - run_python_code(code=...)\n\nIt seems I was able to run the code, but there was an issue with retrieving the specific test results. I'll print the results from the `fizz_buzz` function for the input values 50, 78, and 79 directly within the code block as a workaround to extract the results clearly. Let me execute the function again and display the outputs explicitly.\nRunning:\n - run_python_code(code=...)\n\nHere is the implementation result:\n\n1. **fizz_buzz(50)** \u2192 `0`: No occurrences of the digit '7' in integers divisible by 11 or 13 below 50.\n2. **fizz_buzz(78)** \u2192 `2`: Two occurrences of the digit '7' in integers divisible by 11 or 13 below 78.\n3. **fizz_buzz(79)** \u2192 `3`: Three occurrences of the digit '7' in integers divisible by 11 or 13 below 79.\n\nLet me know if you need further clarification or improvements!", "tools": {"python_tool": [0.000708012, 0.000260961, 0.000295481, 0.000203095]}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [45.419487953186035], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.670740127563477, 9.428003072738647, 5.650470018386841, 5.749686002731323, 14.055280208587646]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [910, 1224, 1416, 1582, 1732], "completion": [278, 168, 151, 135, 124], "total": [1188, 1392, 1567, 1717, 1856]}}}

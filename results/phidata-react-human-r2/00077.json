Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Find Prime Numbers Less Than 100:** We need a list of prime numbers less than 100 since we need to consider their combinations.\n2. **Check Combinations of Three Primes:** We will check combinations of three primes to see if their product equals the given number.\n\nHere is a Python function implementing the solution:\n\n```python\ndef is_multiply_prime(a):\n    \"\"\"Returns true if the number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers and false otherwise.\"\"\"\n    \n    # List of prime numbers less than 100\n    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]\n    \n    # If the number is less than the smallest prime triplet product, immediately return False\n    if a < 2 * 3 * 5:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check combinations of three different primes\n    for i in range(len(primes)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(primes)):\n            for k in range(j + 1, len(primes)):\n                if primes[i] * primes[j] * primes[k] == a:\n                    return True\n    return False\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(is_multiply_prime(30))  # Should return True\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Prime List:** We maintain a list of prime numbers less than 100.\n- **Triple Product Check:** We iterate through the combinations of three distinct primes and check if their product equals the number `a`.\n- **Efficiency:** Since `a` is less than 100, and the number of primes less than 100 is relatively small, a triple nested loop is feasible for this problem.\n\nYou can test this function with other numbers less than 100 to verify its correctness.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [10.545910835266113], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.110231876373291]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [912], "completion": [451], "total": [1363]}}}

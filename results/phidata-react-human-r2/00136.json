A word is a sequence of characters separated by spaces. Here is the Python code to achieve that:\n\n```python\ndef check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):\n    # Strip any trailing spaces from the string\n    stripped_txt = txt.rstrip()\n\n    # If stripping leaves us with an empty string, return False\n    if not stripped_txt:\n        return False\n    \n    # Get the last character of the stripped string\n    last_char = stripped_txt[-1]\n\n    # Check if the last character is a letter and if it's not part of a word\n    # A letter not part of a word means it should be the only character or \n    # followed directly by a space (meaning it's not part of any ending word)\n    return last_char.isalpha() and (len(stripped_txt.split()[-1]) == 1)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(\"apple pie\"))   # \u279e False\nprint(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(\"apple pi e\"))  # \u279e True\nprint(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(\"apple pi e \")) # \u279e False\nprint(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(\"\"))            # \u279e False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **rstrip()**: We use `rstrip()` to remove any trailing spaces from the string since trailing spaces shouldn't affect whether the last non-space character is a standalone letter.\n- **Check for emptiness**: If, after stripping, the string is empty, we return `False` since there would be no characters to evaluate.\n- **Check last character**: We get the last character of the stripped string and perform two checks:\n  1. Whether it is an alphabetical character using `isalpha()`.\n  2. Whether that character is the only character in its respective word (by checking if the last component of the split string has length 1).\n\nThis approach accurately determines if the last character that is not a trailing space is a standalone letter.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [10.08778190612793], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.145089864730835]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [968], "completion": [440], "total": [1408]}}}

For every opening bracket `(`, I'll increment the counter, and for every closing bracket `)`, I'll decrement it. If the counter ever becomes negative, it indicates an unmatched closing bracket. In the end, if the counter is zero, all brackets are balanced. Otherwise, they are not.\n\nHere's how I can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:\n    # Initialize a counter to track unmatched opening brackets\n    counter = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each bracket in the string\n    for bracket in brackets:\n        if bracket == '(':\n            counter += 1  # Increment for an opening bracket\n        elif bracket == ')':\n            counter -= 1  # Decrement for a closing bracket\n        \n        # If the counter is negative, there is an unmatched closing bracket\n        if counter < 0:\n            return False\n    \n    # If the counter is zero, all brackets are matched, otherwise they are not\n    return counter == 0\n\n# Test examples\nassert correct_bracketing(\"(\") == False\nassert correct_bracketing(\"()\") == True\nassert correct_bracketing(\"(()())\") == True\nassert correct_bracketing(\")(()\") == False\n```\n\nThis function will correctly determine if the sequence of brackets is properly balanced.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [63.43772578239441], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [8.279736042022705]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [922], "completion": [327], "total": [1249]}}}

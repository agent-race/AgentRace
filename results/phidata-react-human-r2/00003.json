If at any point the balance goes below zero, the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False` after processing all operations.\n\nHere's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:\n    balance = 0\n    for operation in operations:\n        balance += operation\n        if balance < 0:\n            return True\n    return False\n\n# Example usage\nprint(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))      # Output: False\nprint(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Output: True\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- Initialize `balance` to `0`.\n- Loop over each operation in the `operations` list.\n- Adjust the `balance` by adding the current `operation`.\n- If the `balance` becomes less than `0` at any point, return `True`.\n- If the loop completes without the balance going below zero, return `False`.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [8.49042797088623], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.003031969070435]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [948], "completion": [245], "total": [1193]}}}

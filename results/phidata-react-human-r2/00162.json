Start with the first operand: `result = 2`.\n2. Apply the first operator ('+') with the next operand: `result = 2 + 3 = 5`.\n3. Apply the second operator ('*') with the next operand: `result = 5 * 4 = 20`.\n4. Apply the third operator ('-') with the next operand: `result = 20 - 5 = 9`.\n\nThus, the final result is `9`.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [55.19675898551941], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [51.710243940353394]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1039], "completion": [398], "total": [1437]}}}

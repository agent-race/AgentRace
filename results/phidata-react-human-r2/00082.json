Then it iterates through the string and checks each consecutive set of 3 characters to see if they are distinct by converting them into a set and checking the set's length. If any group of three characters is not distinct, the function returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True` once all checks are passed.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [10.906512975692749], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.626514911651611]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [953], "completion": [359], "total": [1312]}}}

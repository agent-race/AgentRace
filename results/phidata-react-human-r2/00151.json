{"query": "\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\n    \"\"\"Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,\n    deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,\n    and returns the resulted list with a sorted order,\n    The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers,\n    and it may contain duplicates.\n    The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word, and you\n    should return the list sorted by that rule.\n    If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.\n    The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.\n    You may assume that all words will have the same length.\n    For example:\n    assert list_sort([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]) => [\"aa\"]\n    assert list_sort([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]) => [\"ab\", \"cd\"]\n    \"\"\"", "answer": "    lst.sort()\n    new_lst = []\n    for i in lst:\n        if len(i)%2 == 0:\n            new_lst.append(i)\n    return sorted(new_lst, key=len)", "result": "Here's the Python implementation of the `sorted_list_sum` function described in the prompt:\n\n```python\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Accepts a list of strings, removes strings with odd lengths, and returns the sorted list.\n    Sorting is performed by length first (ascending) and then alphabetically for strings of\n    the same length.\n\n    Args:\n    - lst (list of str): A list of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n    - list of str: The processed and sorted list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Remove strings with odd lengths\n    filtered_list = [s for s in lst if len(s) % 2 == 0]\n\n    # Sort: first by string length, then alphabetically\n    sorted_list = sorted(filtered_list, key=lambda s: (len(s), s))\n\n    return sorted_list\n\n# Example assertions\nassert sorted_list_sum([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]) == [\"aa\"]\nassert sorted_list_sum([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]) == [\"ab\", \"cd\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Filter Odd-Length Strings**: Use a list comprehension (`[s for s in lst if len(s) % 2 == 0]`) to remove strings whose lengths are odd.\n2. **Sort by Length and Alphabetical Order**: Use the `sorted` function with a key `(len(s), s)`:\n   - `len(s)` ensures the primary sort is by length.\n   - `s` ensures tiebreakers (when lengths are equal) are resolved alphabetically.\n3. **Assertions**: The two examples from the prompt are included (`\"aa\"`, `\"ab\", \"cd\"`).\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to run this implementation or test it further!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [33.13477897644043], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [29.66472315788269]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1018], "completion": [365], "total": [1383]}}}

The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\n2. **Special Factorial Calculation (`special_factorial` function):**\n   - Iterate from 1 to `n` inclusive.\n   - Compute the factorial of each integer in this range and multiply them together to get the Brazilian factorial.\n   - Raise an error if `n` is less than or equal to 0, as the calculation is defined only for positive integers.\n\nYou can use the `special_factorial` function as shown in the example to calculate the Brazilian factorial of any positive integer.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [19.756230115890503], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [17.579314947128296]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [926], "completion": [347], "total": [1273]}}}

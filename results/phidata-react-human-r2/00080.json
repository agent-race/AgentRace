{"query": "\ndef hex_key(num):\n    \"\"\"You have been tasked to write a function that receives \n    a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal \n    digits that are primes (prime number, or a prime, is a natural number \n    greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers).\n    Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.\n    Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...\n    So you have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, \n    B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13).\n    Note: you may assume the input is always correct or empty string, \n    and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.\n    Examples:\n    For num = \"AB\" the output should be 1.\n    For num = \"1077E\" the output should be 2.\n    For num = \"ABED1A33\" the output should be 4.\n    For num = \"123456789ABCDEF0\" the output should be 6.\n    For num = \"2020\" the output should be 2.\n    \"\"\"", "answer": "    primes = ('2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D')\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(0, len(num)):\n        if num[i] in primes:\n            total += 1\n    return total", "result": "To solve the task of counting the number of prime hexadecimal digits in a given string, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify which hexadecimal digits are prime numbers. From the problem statement:\n   - The hexadecimal number is represented by the characters: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F`.\n   - The prime numbers among these are: `2, 3, 5, 7, 11 (B in hex), 13 (D in hex)`.\n   \n2. Map those prime numbers to their corresponding hexadecimal digits: `2, 3, 5, 7, B, D`.\n\n3. Iterate through each character in the input string and count how many of them belong to the set of prime hexadecimal digits.\n\nHere's the complete python function implementing the logic:\n\n```python\ndef hex_key(num):\n    prime_hex_digits = {'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'}\n    return sum(1 for digit in num if digit in prime_hex_digits)\n\n# Test examples\nprint(hex_key(\"AB\"))        # Output: 1\nprint(hex_key(\"1077E\"))     # Output: 2\nprint(hex_key(\"ABED1A33\"))  # Output: 4\nprint(hex_key(\"123456789ABCDEF0\"))  # Output: 6\nprint(hex_key(\"2020\"))      # Output: 2\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- `prime_hex_digits` is a set containing all prime hexadecimal digits.\n- For each digit in the input string, the code checks if it's in `prime_hex_digits`.\n- If it is, it adds 1 to the sum.\n- The result is the total number of prime hexadecimal digits in the string.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [11.312873840332031], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [8.114075899124146]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1130], "completion": [389], "total": [1519]}}}

The base cases are directly returned for `n in {0, 1, 2, 3}`.\n2. We use four variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) to store the last four numbers in the `Fib4` sequence.\n3. Starting from `n=4`, we iteratively compute each next value as `a + b + c + d` and update the four variables to shift the window forward.\n4. This approach avoids both recursion and the need for a large array, making it efficient in both time and space.\n\n### Complexity\n- **Time complexity**: \\(O(n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the input value.\n- **Space complexity**: \\(O(1)\\), as we only use a fixed amount of memory for the four variables.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to run this code or test any specific cases!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [24.151458978652954], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [22.025094032287598]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1001], "completion": [520], "total": [1521]}}}

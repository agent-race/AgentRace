Here's a step-by-step explanation of the implementation:\n\n1. **Check for a Prime Number:** Write a helper function to check if a given number is prime. A prime number is greater than 1 and divisible only by 1 and itself.\n\n2. **Split the Sentence into Words:** Use Python string operations to split the sentence into a list of words.\n\n3. **Filter Words:** Iterate through the list of words and select the ones whose lengths are prime numbers.\n\n4. **Reconstruct the String:** Join the selected words with spaces and return the result.\n\nHere\u2019s the Python code for this function:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(num):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is a prime.\"\"\"\n    if num <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef words_in_sentence(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a string containing words from the input sentence whose lengths are prime numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    words = sentence.split()  # Split the sentence into words\n    # Filter words whose lengths are prime numbers\n    prime_length_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]\n    # Join the filtered words into a single string\n    return \" \".join(prime_length_words)\n\n# Example Usage\nprint(words_in_sentence(\"This is a test\"))  # Output: \"is\"\nprint(words_in_sentence(\"lets go for swimming\"))  # Output: \"go for\"\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **`is_prime` Function:** This checks whether a number is prime using the `math.sqrt` approach for optimization. \n2. **Processing the Sentence:** The sentence is split into words using the `split()` method. Then, a list comprehension is used to filter words based on their lengths.\n3. **Reassembling the Result:** The filtered list of words is joined back together with spaces.\n\n### Examples:\nFor the input `\"This is a test\"`, the word lengths are:\n- `\"This\"`: length 4 (not prime)\n- `\"is\"`: length 2 (prime)\n- `\"a\"`: length 1 (not prime)\n- `\"test\"`: length 4 (not prime)\n\nThus, the output is `\"is\"`.\n\nFor the input `\"lets go for swimming\"`, the word lengths are:\n- `\"lets\"`: length 4 (not prime)\n- `\"go\"`: length 2 (prime)\n- `\"for\"`: length 3 (prime)\n- `\"swimming\"`: length 8 (not prime)\n\nThe output is `\"go for\"`.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [54.478780031204224], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [49.58822298049927]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [978], "completion": [574], "total": [1552]}}}

Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\nfrom functools import reduce\n\ndef sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.\n    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.\n    >>> sum_product([])\n    (0, 1)\n    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])\n    (10, 24)\n    \"\"\"\n    total_sum = sum(numbers)\n    total_product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers, 1) if numbers else 1\n    return (total_sum, total_product)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Sum**: We use the built-in `sum` function which returns `0` for an empty list by default.\n- **Product**: We compute the product using `reduce` with a lambda function that multiplies two numbers. The `reduce` function starts with `1` as the initial value, which acts as the identity element for multiplication. This is crucial for returning `1` when the list is empty.\n- **Output**: The function returns a tuple `(total_sum, total_product)`.\n\nThis solution accounts for both the sum and the product requirements described in the docstring and handles the edge case of an empty list correctly.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [36.0358190536499], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [32.540534019470215]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [940], "completion": [356], "total": [1296]}}}

{"query": "\n\ndef car_race_collision(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.\n    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars\n    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from\n    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide\n    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.\n    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving\n    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.\n\n    This function outputs the number of such collisions.\n    \"\"\"", "answer": "    return n**2", "result": "To determine the number of collisions in this scenario:\n\nIn essence, each car moving left to right will collide with every car moving in the opposite direction (right to left) once they meet at some point along the straight road.\n\nGiven that there are \\( n \\) cars moving left to right and \\( n \\) cars moving right to left, the total number of collisions is simply the product of these two quantities:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of collisions} = n \\times n = n^2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the function can be implemented as follows:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total number of collisions when n cars are moving\n    left to right and n cars are moving right to left.\n    \n    :param n: Number of cars in each direction.\n    :return: Total number of collisions.\n    \"\"\"\n    return n ** 2\n```\n\nIf you'd like, I can further test or validate this implementation for you.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [9.595719814300537], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [6.15457820892334]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [980], "completion": [207], "total": [1187]}}}

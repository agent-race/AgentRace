Therefore, indices like 0, 2, 4, etc., are considered even.\n- **Odd elements**: An odd number is one that is not divisible by 2 (i.e., `x % 2 != 0`).\n- Using a generator comprehension inside the `sum()` function:\n  - `range(0, len(lst), 2)` ensures that we loop over only even indices.\n  - For each of these indices, we filter using `lst[i] % 2 != 0` to include only odd values.\n  - Finally, `sum()` adds these odd values.\n\n### Examples:\n1. **Input:** `solution([5, 8, 7, 1])`\n   - Even positions are `5` (index 0) and `7` (index 2).\n   - Both are odd, so the sum is `5 + 7 = 12`.\n   - **Output:** `12`.\n\n2. **Input:** `solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3])`\n   - Even positions are `3` (index 0), `3` (index 2), and `3` (index 4).\n   - All are odd, so the sum is `3 + 3 + 3 = 9`.\n   - **Output:** `9`.\n\n3. **Input:** `solution([30, 13, 24, 321])`\n   - Even positions are `30` (index 0) and `24` (index 2).\n   - Neither is odd, so the sum is `0`.\n   - **Output:** `0`.\n\nLet me know if you'd like further clarification!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [14.806071996688843], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [11.4306640625]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [928], "completion": [527], "total": [1455]}}}

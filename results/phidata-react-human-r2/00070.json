{"query": "\ndef pluck(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    \"Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes\n    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.\n    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.\n    If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index.\n\n    The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ],\n    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].\n\n    Example 1:\n        Input: [4,2,3]\n        Output: [2, 1]\n        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.\n\n    Example 2:\n        Input: [1,2,3]\n        Output: [2, 1]\n        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index. \n\n    Example 3:\n        Input: []\n        Output: []\n    \n    Example 4:\n        Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]\n        Output: [0, 1]\n        Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, but  there are two zeros,\n                     so we will choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.\n\n    Constraints:\n        * 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000\n        * 0 <= node.value\n    \"\"\"", "answer": "    if(len(arr) == 0): return []\n    evens = list(filter(lambda x: x%2 == 0, arr))\n    if(evens == []): return []\n    return [min(evens), arr.index(min(evens))]", "result": "Here is the implementation of the `pluck` function:\n\n```python\ndef pluck(arr):\n    # Filter the array to get only the even values and their indices\n    even_values = [(value, index) for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value % 2 == 0]\n    \n    # If there are no even values, return an empty list\n    if not even_values:\n        return []\n    \n    # Sort the even values by their value, and then by index\n    even_values.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n    \n    # Return the smallest even value and its index\n    return list(even_values[0])\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Filter Even Values:** Use a list comprehension to generate a list of tuples `(value, index)` where `value` is the even node value and `index` is its index in the input array.\n2. **Check for Empty Case:** If there are no even values (`even_values` is empty), the function returns `[]`.\n3. **Sort:** Sort the filtered even values first by value and then by index using `sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))`.\n4. **Return Result:** Return the smallest even value and its index as a list `[value, index]`.\n\n### Examples:\n```python\nprint(pluck([4, 2, 3]))  # Output: [2, 1]\nprint(pluck([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [2, 1]\nprint(pluck([]))         # Output: []\nprint(pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]))  # Output: [0, 1]\n``` \n\nThis implementation efficiently handles all given constraints and scenarios.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [10.499327182769775], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.020914077758789]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1143], "completion": [375], "total": [1518]}}}

This ensures spaces are preserved during processing.\n2. **Sorting Characters:** Each word (substring without spaces) is processed by sorting its characters based on ASCII values using Python's `sorted` function.\n3. **Rejoining Strings:** The transformed words are then joined back together with spaces between them using `' '.join(...)`.\n4. **Order Preservation:** The function implicitly preserves the order of words and spaces in the original string.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [9.39490294456482], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [6.430037975311279]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [959], "completion": [296], "total": [1255]}}}

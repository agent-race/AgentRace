It also handles the case where the input list might be empty by returning `0.0`. You can try it with different lists of numbers to verify its correctness.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [11.63417387008667], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [8.637274026870728]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [948], "completion": [295], "total": [1243]}}}

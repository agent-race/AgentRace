The results for the provided examples are:\n\n- For the polynomial with coefficients `[1, 2]` (f(x) = 1 + 2x), the zero is approximately **-0.5**.\n- For the polynomial with coefficients `[-6, 11, -6, 1]` ((x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3), the zero found is **1.0**. \n\nThese results confirm the functionality of the `find_zero` function with the given test cases.

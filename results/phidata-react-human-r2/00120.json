It checks whether the current character is a vowel and ensures it is surrounded by consonants (not vowels). If these conditions are met, the vowel is returned immediately. If no such vowel is found, an empty string is returned.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [24.01830506324768], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [20.573444843292236]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [977], "completion": [381], "total": [1358]}}}

Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you wrap a gift neatly:\n\n### Materials Needed:\n- Wrapping paper\n- Scissors\n- Tape\n- Ribbon (optional)\n- Gift tag (optional)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare Your Workspace:**\n   - Find a flat surface to work on, such as a table or countertop, which allows you to spread out your materials.\n\n2. **Measure the Wrapping Paper:**\n   - Roll out the wrapping paper and place the gift in the center.\n   - Pull enough paper to cover the gift completely, with excess on both sides for folding.\n   - Cut the paper to size, ensuring it\u2019s large enough to wrap around the entire gift with a little extra for overlap.\n\n3. **Position the Gift:**\n   - Place the gift upside down on the paper. This way, the seams will be on the bottom and the top will look clean and neat.\n\n4. **Wrap the Gift:**\n   - Bring one edge of the paper over the gift and tape it down.\n   - Fold the opposite edge of the paper over the gift, overlapping the first edge, and secure it with tape.\n   - Try to keep the paper tight to prevent wrinkles and creases.\n\n5. **Fold the Ends:**\n   - If the gift is a box, stand it up so one of the open sides is facing you.\n   - Push the sides of the paper in to create flaps on the top and bottom.\n   - Fold the top flap down, then the bottom flap up, creating a neat edge. Secure with tape.\n   - Repeat on the other side.\n\n6. **Add Ribbon (Optional):**\n   - Cut a piece of ribbon, long enough to wrap around the gift and tie a bow.\n   - Center the ribbon on the top of the gift, wrap it around, and flip the gift to tie the ribbon underneath.\n   - Bring the ends of the ribbon back to the top and tie a bow. Adjust the loops and tails of the bow as necessary for symmetry.\n\n7. **Attach a Gift Tag (Optional):**\n   - Write a personal message on the gift tag.\n   - Use tape or tie it to the ribbon to secure the tag in place.\n\n### Tips:\n- **Use Double-Sided Tape:** For a cleaner look, use double-sided tape to hide the tape seams.\n- **Crease the Edges:** Run your fingers along the edges of the gift to create crisp creases, which will enhance the overall appearance.\n- **Choose Appropriate Paper:** Use thicker wrapping paper for easier handling and a more polished look.\n\nFollowing these steps will help you achieve a neatly wrapped present that looks professionally done.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1045, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1036, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1029, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1045, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2843, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1036, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2380, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1029, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2494, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 1045, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2839, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 1036, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 2605, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 1029, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 2169, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2488, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 1902, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 2276}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 40, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 53, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 39, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 898, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 58, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 889, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 47, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 882, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 63, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 60, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 49, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 55}, "total_time": [38.42794919013977], "llm_time": {"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.191379070281982, 6.2124598026275635, 7.297759056091309], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [6.167246103286743, 4.852946043014526, 4.229501008987427], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [18.993136167526245, 21.25070309638977, 17.755934953689575], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.1191020011901855]}, "llm_tokens": {"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [43, 43, 43], "completion": [620, 565, 585], "total": [663, 608, 628]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [37, 37, 37], "completion": [538, 662, 500], "total": [575, 699, 537]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [11, 11, 11], "completion": [608, 460, 556], "total": [619, 471, 567]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [15], "completion": [558], "total": [573]}}}

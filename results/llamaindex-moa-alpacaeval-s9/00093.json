This traditional braided bread is slightly sweet, rich, and fluffy, making it perfect for Shabbat, holidays, or any special occasion. Here's a classic recipe for you to try:\n\n### Classic Challah Recipe\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- **1 cup (240 ml) warm water** (about 110\u00b0F/43\u00b0C, warm but not hot)\n- **2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast** or instant yeast\n- **1/4 cup (50 g) granulated sugar**\n- **2 large eggs**\n- **1 large egg yolk** (reserve the white for the egg wash)\n- **1/4 cup (60 ml) vegetable oil** (or another neutral oil)\n- **4 to 4 1/2 cups (500 to 560 g) all-purpose flour** (or bread flour)\n- **1 1/2 teaspoons salt**\n- **Optional toppings:** sesame seeds, poppy seeds, or everything bagel seasoning\n\n#### For the Egg Wash:\n- **1 egg white** (from earlier)\n- **1 tablespoon water**\n\n---\n\n### Instructions:\n\n#### 1. Activate the Yeast:\n- In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm water, yeast, and 1 tablespoon of the sugar. Stir gently and let sit for 5\u201310 minutes, until the mixture becomes foamy and bubbly (this means the yeast is active).\n\n#### 2. Mix the Wet Ingredients:\n- Add the remaining sugar, eggs, egg yolk, and oil to the yeast mixture. Whisk until well combined.\n\n#### 3. Add the Dry Ingredients:\n- Gradually add 4 cups of flour and the salt to the wet ingredients, mixing with a wooden spoon or your hands. If the dough is very sticky, add more flour (a little at a time) until it forms a soft, slightly tacky dough.\n\n#### 4. Knead the Dough:\n- Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 8\u201310 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Alternatively, use a stand mixer with a dough hook for 5\u20137 minutes. The dough should be soft but not sticky.\n\n#### 5. First Rise:\n- Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning it once to coat. Cover with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until doubled in size.\n\n#### 6. Shape the Challah:\n- Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide it into 3, 4, or 6 equal portions, depending on the braid style you want (3-strand is the simplest). Roll each portion into a rope about 12\u201316 inches long.\n- Braid the ropes together, pinching the ends to seal. Tuck the ends under for a neat finish. Transfer the braided loaf to a parchment-lined baking sheet.\n\n#### 7. Second Rise:\n- Cover the loaf loosely with a kitchen towel and let rise for another 30\u201345 minutes, until puffed.\n\n#### 8. Preheat the Oven:\n- While the dough is rising, preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).\n\n#### 9. Egg Wash and Toppings:\n- In a small bowl, whisk together the reserved egg white and 1 tablespoon of water. Brush the egg wash generously over the loaf, making sure to coat all the crevices. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, poppy seeds, or your desired topping, if using.\n\n#### 10. Bake:\n- Bake the challah in the preheated oven for 25\u201330 minutes, or until golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. If it\u2019s browning too quickly, tent it loosely with aluminum foil.\n\n#### 11. Cool:\n- Let the challah cool on a wire rack before slicing. Enjoy it fresh, or use leftovers for French toast or bread pudding!\n\n---\n\n### Tips:\n- **Make it sweeter:** Add an extra tablespoon or two of sugar if you prefer a sweeter challah.\n- **Add-ins:** Mix raisins, chocolate chips, or other fillings into the dough before braiding for a fun variation.\n- **Storage:** Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or freeze for longer storage.\n\nEnjoy your delicious homemade challah!

{"query": "instruction: Do you know why turkeys became the official food of thanksgiving?", "answer": "The origin of turkey as a Thanksgiving staple is unclear, but it is believed that the bird was served at the first Thanksgiving feast in 1621. Turkeys are plentiful in the United States, so they became a popular choice for holiday meals. They also provide a larger quantity of meat than other birds, making them a convenient choice for large family gatherings.", "result": "assistant: Turkeys became the official food of Thanksgiving in the United States primarily due to tradition and practicality. There are several factors that contributed to this:\n\n1. **Historical Accounts**: The most famous account of the first Thanksgiving in 1621 involves the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag people. While it is uncertain if turkey was served, wildfowl was mentioned, and turkeys were native to North America and available to the settlers.\n\n2. **Benjamin Franklin's Advocacy**: Although it\u2019s a myth that Benjamin Franklin wanted the turkey to be the national bird, he did express admiration for the bird, calling it \u201ca much more respectable bird\u201d than the bald eagle. This sentiment helped associate the turkey with American tradition.\n\n3. **Practicality**: Turkeys are large birds that can feed many people, making them suitable for large gatherings and celebrations like Thanksgiving. They were also relatively affordable and widely available in the U.S.\n\n4. **Cultural Tradition**: Over time, as Thanksgiving became institutionalized as a national holiday, turkey dinners became a tradition, reinforced by cultural practices, media, and recipes in cookbooks.\n\n5. **Presidential Influence**: Various U.S. presidents have played a role in cementing the turkey as the Thanksgiving staple. Abraham Lincoln declared Thanksgiving a national holiday in 1863, and subsequent presidents often mentioned turkey in their proclamations.\n\nAll these factors combined over time to establish turkey as the quintessential Thanksgiving dish in American culture.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1079, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1070, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1063, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1079, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 1795, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1070, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 1904, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1063, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2148, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 1079, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 1706, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 1070, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 1874, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 1063, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 1777, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2546, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2724, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 2215}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 19, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 23, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 27, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 898, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 21, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 889, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 23, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 882, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 21, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 33, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 30, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 32}, "total_time": [33.88748598098755], "llm_time": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.4072210788726807, 3.364687919616699, 3.8455541133880615], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.653720855712891, 4.767906904220581, 5.277375936508179], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [19.87071204185486, 26.656676054000854, 19.052453994750977], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [4.76791787147522]}, "llm_tokens": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [43, 43, 43], "completion": [348, 334, 343], "total": [391, 377, 386]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [49, 49, 49], "completion": [354, 418, 368], "total": [403, 467, 417]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [16, 16, 16], "completion": [540, 576, 458], "total": [556, 592, 474]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [20], "completion": [299], "total": [319]}}}

Kubdari is a traditional Georgian meat-filled bread, originating from the Svaneti region. It's hearty, flavorful, and perfect for impressing your guests. Here\u2019s a recipe for Kubdari:\n\n### **Ingredients**  \n#### For the Dough:\n- 3 cups (375 g) all-purpose flour\n- 1 tsp salt\n- 1 tsp sugar\n- 1 tsp dry yeast\n- 1 cup (240 ml) warm milk\n- 2 tbsp vegetable oil\n\n#### For the Filling:\n- 1 lb (450 g) beef and/or pork, finely diced or ground (traditional Kubdari uses a mix of both)\n- 1 medium onion, finely chopped\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 tsp ground coriander\n- 1 tsp ground cumin\n- 1 tsp paprika\n- \u00bd tsp chili flakes (optional, for a bit of spice)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- 2 tbsp fresh cilantro or parsley, chopped (optional, for added freshness)\n\n### **Instructions**  \n#### Step 1: Prepare the Dough\n1. In a small bowl, combine the warm milk, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5\u201310 minutes until frothy.\n2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and vegetable oil, then knead into a soft dough. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour; if it\u2019s dry, add a touch more milk.\n3. Knead the dough for about 8\u201310 minutes, until smooth. Cover the bowl with a clean towel and let the dough rise in a warm place for 1\u20131.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.\n\n#### Step 2: Prepare the Filling\n1. In a mixing bowl, combine the diced or ground meat, onion, garlic, coriander, cumin, paprika, chili flakes (if using), salt, pepper, and fresh herbs (if using). Mix thoroughly to combine.\n\n#### Step 3: Assemble the Kubdari\n1. Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n2. Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into two equal portions for two medium-sized Kubdari, or into four portions for smaller ones.\n3. Roll out each portion into a flat, circular shape, about 8\u201310 inches in diameter.\n4. Place a generous amount of filling in the center of the dough circle, leaving some space around the edges.\n5. Fold the edges of the dough over the filling, pinching them together at the top to seal the bread. Gently flatten the filled dough into a circular shape, ensuring the filling is evenly distributed inside.\n6. Make a small hole or slit in the center to allow steam to escape while baking.\n\n#### Step 4: Bake\n1. Place the Kubdari on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n2. Bake for 25\u201330 minutes, or until golden brown.\n3. Brush the top with a little melted butter after baking for added flavor and shine.\n\n#### Step 5: Serve\nAllow the Kubdari to cool slightly before slicing into it. Serve warm and enjoy the flavorful, juicy filling with the soft bread. It pairs wonderfully with a crisp salad or a glass of Georgian wine, like Saperavi.\n\nEnjoy hosting your guests with this delicious Georgian specialty!

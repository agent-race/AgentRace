It\u2019s a traditional Ukrainian and Russian dish, made with fresh vegetables, cooked potatoes, eggs, and a tangy base (often kvass, kefir, or a mixture of water and sour cream). Here\u2019s a classic recipe for Okroshka:\n\n---\n\n### **Ukrainian Okroshka Recipe (Serves 4-6)**\n\n#### **Ingredients:**\n\n- **Vegetables:**\n  - 2 medium potatoes (boiled, peeled, and diced)\n  - 4-5 radishes (finely chopped)\n  - 1 small cucumber (diced)\n  - 3 green onions (finely chopped)\n  - A small bunch of fresh dill (finely chopped)\n  \n- **Protein:**\n  - 3 hard-boiled eggs (diced)\n  - 200-300g cooked meat (optional; such as boiled chicken, beef, ham, or even sausage, diced)\n\n- **Liquid Base:**\n  - 3 cups kefir (or plain yogurt, thinned with water for a smoother texture)\n  - 1\u20132 cups cold water or sparkling water (adjust for desired soup consistency)\n  - Juice of 1 lemon (or 1-2 tbsp white vinegar, to taste)\n  - Salt and black pepper (to taste)\n  - Optional: 1 tsp mustard (for a little kick)\n\n- **Garnish:**\n  - Fresh dill or parsley (additional, for serving)\n  - Sour cream (optional, for serving)\n\n---\n\n#### **Instructions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Ingredients:**\n   - Boil the potatoes in their skins until tender, then let them cool, peel, and dice into small cubes.\n   - Hard-boil the eggs, peel, and dice them.\n   - Chop the cucumber, radishes, green onions, and dill.\n   - If using meat, dice it into small, bite-sized pieces.\n\n2. **Combine the Ingredients:**\n   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the diced potatoes, eggs, cucumber, radishes, green onions, dill, and meat (if using).\n\n3. **Prepare the Liquid Base:**\n   - In a separate bowl or pitcher, whisk together the kefir, water, lemon juice (or vinegar), salt, and pepper.

Enjoy!", "result": "assistant: Milanesa de peceto is a classic Argentinian dish, which is essentially breaded beef that is fried to crispy perfection. It's a popular dish that can be served with various sides like mashed potatoes, salad, or fries. Here's a traditional recipe for Milanesa de peceto:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 1 kg (about 2.2 lbs) of peceto (eye of round) beef, sliced into thin steaks\n- 3 cups breadcrumbs\n- 1 cup all-purpose flour\n- 3 eggs\n- 1 cup milk\n- 2 cloves garlic, finely minced\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Vegetable oil for frying\n- Lemon wedges for serving\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Beef Steaks:**\n   - Slice the peceto into thin steaks (about 1/4 inch thick). If your butcher hasn't already done so, you can tenderize the beef by gently pounding it with a meat mallet.\n\n2. **Seasoning:**\n   - Season the steaks with salt, pepper, and minced garlic. Let them sit for about 15-20 minutes to absorb the flavors.\n\n3. **Prepare the Breading Station:**\n   - Place flour in one shallow dish.\n   - In a separate shallow dish, beat the eggs and milk together until combined.\n   - In a third shallow dish, spread out the breadcrumbs.\n\n4. **Bread the Steaks:**\n   - Dredge each steak first in the flour, ensuring it's evenly coated.\n   - Dip the steak into the egg and milk mixture, allowing any excess to drip off.\n   - Finally, press the steak into the breadcrumbs, making sure it's thoroughly covered. You can press down slightly to ensure the breadcrumbs adhere well.\n\n5. **Fry the Milanesa:**\n   - Heat vegetable oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. You should have enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan generously.\n   - Once the oil is hot (approximately 350\u00b0F/175\u00b0C), carefully place the breaded steaks into the pan. Fry them in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding.\n   - Cook each steak for about 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy.\n   - Remove them from the pan and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.\n\n6. **Serve:**\n   - Serve the Milanesa de peceto hot with lemon wedges on the side. It's great with mashed potatoes, salad, or fries.\n\n### Tips:\n- For a lighter version, you can bake the breaded steaks in the oven at 200\u00b0C (400\u00b0F) for about 20 minutes, flipping halfway through.\n- Feel free to add herbs or spices like parsley or paprika to the breadcrumbs for additional flavor.\n\nEnjoy your delicious homemade Milanesa de peceto!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1252, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1243, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1236, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1252, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2004, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1243, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 1907, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1236, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2312, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 1252, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 2241, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 1243, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2846, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 1236, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 2184, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2424, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2380, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 2715}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 41, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 44, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 58, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 898, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 39, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 889, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 63, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 882, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 56, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 55, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 53, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 52}, "total_time": [44.51450490951538], "llm_time": {"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.508969068527222, 4.581766843795776, 5.43559193611145], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.614544153213501, 6.216090202331543, 8.366986989974976], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [21.18001699447632, 32.90810203552246, 23.482943058013916], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [10.280298948287964]}, "llm_tokens": {"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [89, 89, 89], "completion": [509, 478, 553], "total": [598, 567, 642]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [83, 83, 83], "completion": [565, 715, 552], "total": [648, 798, 635]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [56, 56, 56], "completion": [625, 630, 710], "total": [681, 686, 766]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [60], "completion": [575], "total": [635]}}}

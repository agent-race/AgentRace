Fl\u00e6skesteg, or Danish Roast Pork with Crackling, is a traditional and beloved dish in Denmark, often served during Christmas but also enjoyed year-round. The crispy crackling is the star of the dish, and it's typically paired with red cabbage and caramelized potatoes. Here's a recipe to help you make this delicious dish at home:\n\n---\n\n### **Fl\u00e6skesteg (Danish Roast Pork with Crackling)**\n\n#### **Ingredients**\n- 1.5\u20132 kg (3\u20134 lb) pork loin or pork shoulder with the rind on\n- 1\u20132 tablespoons coarse sea salt\n- 2\u20133 bay leaves\n- 4\u20135 whole cloves\n- 1\u20132 cups water\n\n#### **Optional for Serving**\n- Red cabbage (R\u00f8dk\u00e5l) \u2013 store-bought or homemade\n- Caramelized potatoes (Brunede Kartofler)\n- Gravy made from the pan drippings\n\n---\n\n#### **Instructions**\n\n1. **Prepare the Pork:**\n   - Preheat your oven to 220\u00b0C (425\u00b0F).\n   - Using a sharp knife, score the pork rind in parallel lines about 1 cm (1/2 inch) apart. Be careful not to cut into the meat\u2014just the rind and fat layer.\n   - Rub coarse sea salt thoroughly into the scored rind, ensuring it gets into the cuts. This is essential for achieving crispy crackling.\n   - Insert the bay leaves and cloves into some of the cuts for flavor.\n\n2. **Roast the Pork:**\n   - Place the pork in a roasting pan, rind-side up, on a rack or on top of some chopped vegetables (e.g., onions, carrots, and celery) to keep it elevated.\n   - Pour 1\u20132 cups of water into the bottom of the pan. This will create steam to keep the meat moist and collect drippings for gravy.\n   - Roast the pork at 220\u00b0C (425\u00b0F) for about 15\u201320 minutes to start crisping up the rind.\n\n3. **Lower the Temperature:**\n   - Reduce the oven temperature to 180\u00b0C (350\u00b0F) and continue roasting for approximately 1.5\u20132 hours, depending on the size of the roast. A meat thermometer should read 65\u201370\u00b0C (150\u2013160\u00b0F) in the thickest part of the meat when done.\n   - Check periodically to ensure the water hasn't completely evaporated; add more if necessary.\n\n4. **Get the Crackling Perfect:**\n   - If the crackling isn't fully crispy by the end of the cooking time, turn the oven back up to 220\u00b0C (425\u00b0F) for a few minutes. Keep a close eye on it to prevent burning.\n\n5. **Rest the Meat:**\n   - Remove the roast from the oven and let it rest for about 10\u201315 minutes before slicing. This allows the juices to redistribute.\n\n6. **Make the Gravy (Optional):**\n   - Pour the pan drippings into a small saucepan, skim off excess fat, and heat gently. If you like, you can thicken the gravy with a bit of flour or cornstarch mixed with water.\n\n---\n\n#### **Serve:**\nSlice the Fl\u00e6skesteg and serve it with traditional Danish accompaniments like red cabbage, caramelized potatoes, boiled potatoes, and the optional gravy.\n\n---\n\n### **Pro Tips for Success**\n- The key to crispy crackling is ensuring the rind is dry before you begin. If the rind seems moist, you can pat it dry with a paper towel or leave it uncovered in the fridge for a few hours before roasting.\n- Use coarse sea salt rather than fine salt for better results with the crackling.\n- Don\u2019t rush the resting step\u2014it\u2019s crucial for juicy meat.\n\nEnjoy hosting your guests with this classic Danish dish!

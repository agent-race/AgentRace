Canjeero (also spelled **Lahoh**) is a traditional Somali fermented flatbread that is commonly served for breakfast or alongside meals. It\u2019s soft, spongy, and slightly tangy, making it a wonderful accompaniment to stews, tea, or spreads. Here\u2019s how to make Canjeero at home:\n\n---\n\n### **Canjeero Recipe (Somali Fermented Flatbread)**\n\n#### **Ingredients**:\n- 2 cups all-purpose flour (or you can use a mix of white and whole wheat flour)\n- 2 cups fine semolina flour (adds texture and flavor)\n- 1 teaspoon sugar\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n- 1 teaspoon instant yeast\n- 2 1/2 cups warm water (adjust as needed for the right consistency)\n- Cooking oil (for greasing the pan)\n\n---\n\n#### **Instructions**:\n\n1. **Prepare the Batter**:\n   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, sugar, salt, and instant yeast.\n   - Gradually add the warm water while stirring to create a smooth, lump-free batter. The consistency should be thinner than pancake batter but not watery. If needed, use a whisk or blender to ensure the batter is smooth.\n\n2. **Ferment the Batter**:\n   - Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let the batter ferment at room temperature for **2-4 hours** (or overnight, if you prefer a stronger tangy flavor). The batter will rise slightly and may develop bubbles.\n\n3. **Cook the Canjeero**:\n   - Heat a non-stick skillet or flat griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease the pan with a small amount of oil.\n   - Stir the batter gently and pour a ladleful onto the hot pan. Swirl the pan quickly to spread the batter into a thin, even circle (similar to making crepes).\n   - Cook the Canjeero for **2-3 minutes**, or until the top is dry and the bottom develops light golden spots. Canjeero is traditionally cooked on one side only, so don\u2019t flip it.\n   - Remove the Canjeero from the pan and place it on a clean kitchen towel. Repeat with the remaining batter, stacking the Canjeero flatbread as you go.\n\n4. **Serve**:\n   - Canjeero is traditionally served warm, often with a drizzle of sesame oil, butter, or ghee. It pairs wonderfully with tea (Shaah), stews, or sweet spreads like honey and sugar.\n\n---\n\n#### **Tips**:\n- If the batter is too thick, add a little more water to thin it out.\n- For a more authentic flavor, you can substitute some of the all-purpose flour with sorghum flour, which is commonly used in Somalia.\n- Some recipes add a pinch of baking powder to make the Canjeero slightly puffier.\n\n---\n\nEnjoy your homemade Canjeero!

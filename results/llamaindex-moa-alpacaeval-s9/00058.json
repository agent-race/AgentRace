Koldsk\u00e5l is a classic Danish dish\u2014light, refreshing, and perfect for summer. It's a chilled buttermilk dessert soup that\u2019s often served with crispy biscuits called *kammerjunkere*. Here's a simple recipe for you to try:\n\n---\n\n### **Koldsk\u00e5l (Danish Buttermilk Dessert Soup)**\n\n#### **Ingredients** (Serves 4)\n- 2 cups (500 ml) buttermilk\n- 1 cup (250 ml) plain yogurt (preferably Greek or full-fat)\n- 2 egg yolks\n- 3 tablespoons sugar (or to taste)\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (or seeds from 1 vanilla pod)\n- Zest of 1 lemon (optional, for extra freshness)\n- Juice of \u00bd lemon (optional, for tanginess)\n\n#### **For Serving**\n- *Kammerjunkere* (Danish crispy biscuits) or you can substitute with vanilla wafer cookies or crumbled shortbread\n- Fresh berries (e.g., strawberries, raspberries, or blueberries) for garnish (optional)\n\n---\n\n#### **Instructions**\n\n1. **Prepare the Base:**\n   - In a large mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar together until the mixture becomes pale and creamy.\n   - Add the vanilla extract (or vanilla seeds) and mix well.\n\n2. **Add Dairy:**\n   - Gradually whisk in the buttermilk and yogurt until smooth and well combined.\n   - If you\u2019re using lemon zest or juice, gently stir it into the mixture at this stage.\n\n3. **Chill:**\n   - Cover the bowl and refrigerate the koldsk\u00e5l for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour. This allows the flavors to meld and ensures it\u2019s nicely chilled.\n\n4. **Serve:**\n   - Pour the koldsk\u00e5l into individual bowls or glasses.\n   - Top with *kammerjunkere* and, if desired, fresh berries for added texture and flavor.\n\n---\n\n### **Tips:**\n- If you can\u2019t find buttermilk, you can substitute it with a mixture of milk and a little lemon juice or white vinegar (let it sit for 5\u201310 minutes to curdle slightly).\n- For a lighter version, you can use low-fat yogurt and buttermilk, but the flavor is richer with full-fat ingredients.\n- Store any leftover koldsk\u00e5l in the fridge for up to 2 days.\n\nThis dish is perfect for a summer gathering, as it\u2019s refreshing and easy to prepare ahead of time. Your guests will love its creamy texture and tangy-sweet flavor!

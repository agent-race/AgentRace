Sewing a button on a shirt is a straightforward task, and I\u2019ll guide you through it step by step:\n\n### Materials You'll Need:\n1. The button you want to attach.\n2. Needle.\n3. Thread (match the thread color to the shirt for a clean look).\n4. Scissors.\n5. A pin, toothpick, or small object (optional, for creating a thread shank for flexibility).\n6. Thimble (optional, for protecting your finger).\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions:\n\n#### 1. **Thread the Needle**\n   - Cut a piece of thread about 24 inches long.\n   - Thread the needle and tie a small knot at the end of the thread.\n\n#### 2. **Position the Button**\n   - Place the button on the shirt where it needs to be sewn. If you're replacing a button, you can use the existing holes as a guide.\n   - Align the button so it matches the placement of other buttons on the shirt.\n\n#### 3. **Anchor the Thread**\n   - Start by pushing the needle from the underside of the fabric to the top where the button will sit.\n   - Pull the thread through until the knot stops it on the underside.\n\n#### 4. **Sew the Button**\n   - For a **4-hole button**:\n     1. Insert the needle into one hole of the button, then through the diagonally opposite hole, pulling the thread tight.\n     2. Repeat this process 2-3 times to secure the thread.\n     3. Move to the other pair of holes and sew in the same way (diagonally or in a square pattern).\n   - For a **2-hole button**:\n     1. Insert the needle into one hole, then through the other hole, pulling tight.\n     2. Repeat this process 4-5 times until the button feels secure.\n\n#### 5. **Create a Thread Shank (Optional)**\n   - If the button needs some flexibility (e.g., for a thick fabric), slip a pin, toothpick, or small object under the button while sewing.\n   - After sewing the button securely, remove the pin and wrap the thread around the base of the button several times to form a \"shank.\" This provides extra space for the button to move.\n\n#### 6. **Secure the Thread**\n   - Push the needle to the underside of the fabric.\n   - Tie a small knot close to the fabric to secure the thread.\n   - For extra security, make a second knot.\n\n#### 7. **Trim the Thread**\n   - Use scissors to carefully trim any excess thread close to the knot.\n\n---\n\n### Tips:\n- If the shirt is delicate, consider using a double thread for added strength.\n- Use a thimble if the fabric is thick or hard to push the needle through.\n- Practice on a scrap piece of fabric if you're new to sewing.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1072, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1063, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1056, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1072, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2364, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1063, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2266, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1056, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2308, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 1072, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2224, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 1063, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 2223, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 1056, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 2522, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2598, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2317, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 2382}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 46, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 41, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 38, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 898, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 50, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 889, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 37, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 882, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 49, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 65, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 57, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 59}, "total_time": [46.466150999069214], "llm_time": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.74929404258728, 4.416254997253418, 5.34086799621582], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.832897901535034, 6.261198997497559, 6.057336807250977], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [17.94391703605652, 20.91090416908264, 26.420774936676025], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.6891279220581055]}, "llm_tokens": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [44, 44, 44], "completion": [538, 518, 568], "total": [582, 562, 612]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [50, 50, 50], "completion": [511, 514, 491], "total": [561, 564, 541]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [18, 18, 18], "completion": [630, 549, 582], "total": [648, 567, 600]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [22], "completion": [608], "total": [630]}}}

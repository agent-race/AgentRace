Here are some tips to help you keep your table in excellent condition:\n\n### **1. Cleaning**\n- **Dust regularly:** Use a soft, dry cloth or microfiber cloth to gently dust the table to prevent dirt buildup.\n- **Wipe spills immediately:** Wooden tables are prone to stains and damage from liquids. Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe spills promptly, and dry the surface with a dry cloth afterward.\n- **Use mild cleaners:** Avoid harsh chemicals that can damage the wood finish. If needed, mix a small amount of dish soap with water and use it to clean the table. Dry thoroughly afterward.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Protecting the Surface**\n- **Use coasters and placemats:** Prevent water rings, heat damage, and scratches by placing coasters under drinks and placemats under plates.\n- **Avoid direct sunlight:** Prolonged exposure to sunlight can cause fading or discoloration. Position the table away from windows or use curtains/blinds to minimize exposure.\n- **Maintain humidity levels:** Wood can warp or crack if exposed to extreme dryness or excess moisture. Keep your home\u2019s humidity levels consistent (ideally between 40\u201350%).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Preventing Scratches and Damage**\n- **Avoid dragging items:** Lift objects when moving them, instead of dragging them across the surface.\n- **Trim pet nails:** If you have pets, keep their nails trimmed to prevent scratches.\n- **Use felt pads:** Put felt pads under heavy or scratch-prone items like vases, lamps, or decorative objects.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Refinishing and Polishing**\n- **Polish or wax periodically:** Use a high-quality wood polish or wax to maintain the shine and protect the finish. Apply it sparingly (once every few months or as needed), and follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n- **Touch up scratches:** For minor scratches, use a wood touch-up pen or filler that matches the table's color.\n- **Refinish when needed:** Over time, the finish may wear down. Consider refinishing the table if it shows signs of significant wear, scratches, or fading.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Handling Heat and Moisture**\n- **Use heat-resistant mats:** Place heat-resistant mats or trivets under hot dishes to avoid heat damage.\n- **Avoid leaving wet items:** Don\u2019t leave wet towels, glasses, or other items on the table for long periods, as they can cause water stains or rings.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Seasonal Maintenance**\n- **Inspect for damage:** Regularly check for signs of wear, cracks, or loose joints. Address any issues promptly to prevent further damage.\n- **Treat with oil (if needed):** For tables with an oil finish, apply wood oil periodically to keep the surface hydrated and prevent drying or cracking.\n\n---\n\nBy following these tips, your wooden table will remain beautiful and functional for many years!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1051, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1042, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1035, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1051, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 1843, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1042, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2589, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1035, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2766, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 1051, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2294, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 1042, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 2393, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 1035, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 2455, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 1985, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2258, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 2137}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 31, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 28, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 28, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 898, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 38, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 889, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 29, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 882, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 42, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 33, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 34, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 39}, "total_time": [50.59393906593323], "llm_time": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.751710891723633, 4.2070231437683105, 7.55442214012146], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.930957078933716, 4.803262948989868, 4.548271894454956], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [14.30007004737854, 19.5031578540802, 32.63978600502014], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [8.57405400276184]}, "llm_tokens": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [39, 39, 39], "completion": [390, 481, 523], "total": [429, 520, 562]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [45, 45, 45], "completion": [554, 580, 495], "total": [599, 625, 540]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [13, 13, 13], "completion": [460, 520, 504], "total": [473, 533, 517]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [17], "completion": [603], "total": [620]}}}

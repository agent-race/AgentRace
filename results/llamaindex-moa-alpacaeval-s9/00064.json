They're relatively easy to make, delicious, and sure to impress. Here's a recipe for Israeli Cheese Bourekas:\n\n---\n\n### **Israeli Cheese Bourekas Recipe**\n\n#### **Ingredients**\n- 1 package (about 1 lb or 500g) puff pastry, thawed\n- 1 cup (200g) crumbled feta cheese\n- 1/2 cup (120g) ricotta cheese or farmer's cheese\n- 1/4 cup (25g) grated Parmesan cheese (optional, for extra flavor)\n- 1 large egg (for the filling)\n- 1 large egg (for egg wash)\n- 1/4 tsp black pepper\n- 1/4 tsp salt (optional, depending on the saltiness of the cheeses)\n- 1 tbsp sesame seeds or nigella seeds (optional, for topping)\n\n---\n\n#### **Instructions**\n\n1. **Preheat the oven**:\n   Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n\n2. **Prepare the filling**:\n   In a mixing bowl, combine the feta cheese, ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese (if using), 1 egg, black pepper, and salt (if needed). Mix until smooth and well combined.\n\n3. **Prepare the puff pastry**:\n   Roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface, if necessary, and cut it into squares (about 4x4 inches or 10x10 cm).\n\n4. **Assemble the bourekas**:\n   - Place about 1 tablespoon of the cheese filling in the center of each puff pastry square.\n   - Fold the pastry diagonally to form a triangle and press down the edges with a fork to seal (you can also shape them into rectangles or other shapes if you prefer).\n\n5. **Apply the egg wash**:\n   In a small bowl, beat the second egg. Brush the tops of the bourekas with the egg wash to give them a golden color when baked.\n\n6. **Add toppings** (optional):\n   Sprinkle sesame seeds or nigella seeds on top of the bourekas for added texture and flavor.\n\n7. **Bake**:\n   Place the bourekas on the prepared baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 20\u201325 minutes, or until they are puffed up and golden brown.\n\n8. **Cool and serve**:\n   Let the bourekas cool slightly before serving. They can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature.\n\n---\n\n### **Serving Suggestions**\n- Serve the bourekas with a side of Israeli salad (chopped cucumbers and tomatoes with olive oil and lemon juice).\n- Pair them with a dipping sauce like tahini or a dollop of sour cream.\n\nThese bourekas are sure to be a hit! You can also experiment with other fillings like mashed potatoes, spinach and cheese, or mushrooms to keep things interesting for future gatherings.

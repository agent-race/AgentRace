If it is, the function immediately returns an empty list `[]`.\n- We initialize `smallest_even` and `index_of_smallest` to `None`. These will hold respectively the smallest even value found in the array and its index.\n- As we loop through the array (`for i, value in enumerate(arr)`), we check if the current `value` is even (`value % 2 == 0`).\n- If it is even and either `smallest_even` is `None` (indicating the first even node found) or the current `value` is smaller than `smallest_even`, we update `smallest_even` and `index_of_smallest`.\n- After the loop, if `smallest_even` is still `None`, no even number was found, so we return an empty list.\n- Otherwise, we return `[smallest_even, index_of_smallest]`.\n\nThis implementation covers all scenarios mentioned in the examples and constraints.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [16.58600115776062], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [14.668503046035767]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1143], "completion": [465], "total": [1608]}}}

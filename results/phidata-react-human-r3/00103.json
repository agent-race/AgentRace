The function validates if `x` is smaller than or equal to `y`. If not, it returns `-1` immediately since the range is invalid.\n2. It iterates backward from `y` to `x` (inclusive) checking each number to see if it's even.\n3. The first even number encountered is returned since we are iterating in decreasing order, ensuring the largest even number is found.\n\nFeel free to test this implementation or let me know if you'd like further clarification!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [7.838794946670532], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.889394998550415]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [924], "completion": [293], "total": [1217]}}}

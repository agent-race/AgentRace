If odd, we calculate the sum and append it.\n- Finally, we return the constructed list.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [8.091061115264893], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.909908056259155]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [955], "completion": [393], "total": [1348]}}}

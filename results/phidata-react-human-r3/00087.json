The requirements for sorting are that rows are sorted in ascending order, but within each row, the columns should be sorted in descending order.\n\nHere's an analysis of how the function should work based on the problem statement:\n\n1. **Iterate through Rows:** \n   - For each row in the list, examine each element to check if it matches `x`.\n\n2. **Collect Coordinates:**\n   - If an element matches `x`, record the tuple `(row_index, column_index)` indicating its position in the matrix (with indices starting at 0).\n\n3. **Sort Coordinates:**\n   - First, sort the list of coordinates by row in ascending order.\n   - Then, within each group of coordinates that share the same row index, sort by column in descending order.\n\n4. **Output Result:**\n   - Return the list of sorted coordinates.\n\nLet's write the implementation of this function:\n\n```python\ndef get_row(lst, x):\n    coordinates = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each row\n    for row_index, row in enumerate(lst):\n        # Find all column indices with value x\n        col_indices = [col_index for col_index, value in enumerate(row) if value == x]\n        \n        # Add found indices paired with their row index to coordinates\n        for col_index in col_indices:\n            coordinates.append((row_index, col_index))\n    \n    # Sort by row in ascending order; then by column in descending order within each row\n    coordinates.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))\n    \n    return coordinates\n\n# Testing the example cases:\nprint(get_row([\n  [1,2,3,4,5,6],\n  [1,2,3,4,1,6],\n  [1,2,3,4,5,1]\n], 1))  # Output: [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]\n\nprint(get_row([], 1))  # Output: []\n\nprint(get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3))  # Output: [(2, 2)]\n```\n\nThis function successfully implements the logic described in the problem statement and should return the expected results for the given examples.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [7.846717119216919], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [6.315431118011475]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1090], "completion": [522], "total": [1612]}}}

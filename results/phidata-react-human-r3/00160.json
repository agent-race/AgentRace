Calculate the number of carrots you can eat (`carrots_to_eat`). This is the smaller value between `need` (carrots you want to eat) and `remaining` (carrots in stock).\n2. Update the total carrots eaten (`total_eaten`) by adding the carrots you just ate to the ones you already ate.\n3. Calculate remaining carrots after the meal (`remaining_carrots`), which is `remaining` minus `carrots_to_eat`.\n4.

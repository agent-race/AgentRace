A copy of the original list is maintained (`result`). The values at indices divisible by 3 in the copy are replaced with the sorted values.\n4. The function finally returns the modified list.\n\nLet me know if you'd like this code tested or if you have further questions!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [16.78090500831604], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [13.337728023529053]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [984], "completion": [392], "total": [1376]}}}

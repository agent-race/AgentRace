Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:\n    \"\"\" Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,\n    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1\n    \"\"\"\n    min_number = min(numbers)\n    max_number = max(numbers)\n    return [(x - min_number) / (max_number - min_number) for x in numbers]\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]))  # Output: [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Find the minimum and maximum**: Calculate `min_number` and `max_number` from the list of numbers.\n2. **Linear Transformation**: For each number `x`, apply the transformation: \n   \\[\n   \\text{rescaled\\_x} = \\frac{x - \\text{min\\_number}}{\\text{max\\_number} - \\text{min\\_number}}\n   \\]\n   This formula maps `min_number` to 0 and `max_number` to 1.\n3. **List Comprehension**: Use a list comprehension to apply the transformation to each element in the list.\n\nThis function assumes that the input list contains at least two numbers, as stated in the problem.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [8.069777965545654], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [6.3148181438446045]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [955], "completion": [372], "total": [1327]}}}

This ensures that the digit sum is calculated correctly for negative numbers.\n   \n2. **Tie-breaking Original Index**: If two or more numbers have the same digit sum, the `nums.index(x)` is used as a secondary key to preserve their order based on their original index in the input list.\n\n3. **Sorted**: The `sorted` function is used with the custom `key`, ensuring the required ordering.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [12.269098043441772], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [10.684289932250977]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [946], "completion": [355], "total": [1301]}}}

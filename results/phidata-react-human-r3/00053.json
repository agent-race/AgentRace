How can I help you with this function?\nThought: Perhaps you want to know about how to test this function or if this function is correct. I should clarify.\nFinal Answer: The `add` function in Python is programmed to return the sum of two integers, `x` and `y`. It comes with a docstring that includes example usages showing that `add(2, 3)` results in 5 and `add(5, 7)` results in 12. If you want to execute this function, you need to ensure it's part of a Python program or script, but the logic itself correctly performs addition. If your question was about testing, you can use this documentation for basic doctest-based testing.

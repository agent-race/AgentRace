Here's the implementation of this function:\n\n```python\ndef string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Perform binary XOR on two strings consisting of 1s and 0s.\"\"\"\n    # Ensure both strings have the same length\n    assert len(a) == len(b), \"Strings must be of the same length\"\n\n    # Perform XOR operation for each pair of characters\n    result = ''.join('1' if x != y else '0' for x, y in zip(a, b))\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(string_xor('010', '110'))  # Output: '100'\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function uses Python's `zip` function to pair up corresponding characters from the two strings `a` and `b`.\n- The XOR logic is applied using a simple conditional expression: `('1' if x != y else '0')`.\n- The result is joined into a single string and returned.\n\nThis function assumes that both input strings `a` and `b` are of the same length.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [4.999430894851685], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [3.339263916015625]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [908], "completion": [259], "total": [1167]}}}

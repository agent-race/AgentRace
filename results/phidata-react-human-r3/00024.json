Here's an implementation for this function:\n\n```python\ndef largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\" For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n \"\"\"\n    # Start checking from n-1 down to 1.\n    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return i\n    return None\n\n# Example usage\nprint(largest_divisor(15))  # Output: 5\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function iterates from `n-1` down to `1`.\n- For each `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` using the modulus operator (`%`).\n- The first `i` that divides `n` evenly is returned, as it is the largest divisor less than `n`.\n- If no divisor is found (unlikely for `n > 1`), it returns `None` as a fallback.\n\nThis implementation is straightforward and efficient for the task at hand.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [6.5714781284332275], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [4.800401926040649]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [883], "completion": [246], "total": [1129]}}}

Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\" Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of\n    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')\n    3\n    >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')\n    4\n    \"\"\"\n    return len(set(string.lower()))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- Convert the string to lowercase using `string.lower()` to ensure that the character comparison is case insensitive.\n- Use a set to automatically handle duplicate characters and keep only distinct ones.\n- Return the length of the set, which represents the number of unique characters. \n\nYou can test this function with the provided examples:\n\n```python\nprint(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Output: 3\nprint(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))   # Output: 4\n```", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [6.734744071960449], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [4.936744928359985]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [904], "completion": [228], "total": [1132]}}}

Raise an exception for invalid input.\n\nThis function will calculate the desired \"Brazilian factorial\" efficiently.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [9.623910903930664], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.1931281089782715]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [926], "completion": [354], "total": [1280]}}}

{"query": "\ndef tri(n):\n    \"\"\"Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in \n    the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.\n    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:\n    tri(1) = 3\n    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.\n    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.\n    For example:\n    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2\n    tri(4) = 3\n    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)\n           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 \n    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the \n    first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.\n    Examples:\n    tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]\n    \"\"\"", "answer": "    if n == 0:\n        return [1]\n    my_tri = [1, 3]\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)\n        else:\n            my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)\n    return my_tri", "result": "The description of the `tri` function makes it clear that we need to calculate the first \\( n+1 \\) numbers of the Tribonacci sequence based on the rules provided.\n\nHere's how you can implement it step by step:\n\n1. Define a base case for the first element (\\( tri(1) = 3 \\)).\n2. Use the conditions:\n   - \\( tri(n) = 1 + n / 2 \\), if \\( n \\) is even.\n   - \\( tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1) \\), if \\( n \\) is odd.\n3. Collect the results in a list and return the list of the first \\( n+1 \\) tribonacci values.\n\nHere\u2019s what the function implementation might look like:\n\n```python\ndef tri(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    def tribonacci_recursive(k):\n        # Base case for tri(1)\n        if k == 1:\n            return 3\n        # tri(k) = 1 + k / 2 if k is even\n        if k % 2 == 0:\n            return 1 + k // 2\n        # tri(k) = tri(k-1) + tri(k-2) + tri(k+1) if k is odd\n        else:\n            return (tribonacci_recursive(k - 1) + \n                    tribonacci_recursive(k - 2) + \n                    tribonacci_recursive(k + 1))\n    \n    result = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 2):\n        result.append(tribonacci_recursive(i))\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `tri` that handles the computation recursively. You can use this to produce Tribonacci sequences. However, this recursive method might need optimization (e.g., memoization) as it could be computationally expensive for larger \\( n \\).", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [14.814876794815063], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [12.6472909450531]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1065], "completion": [410], "total": [1475]}}}

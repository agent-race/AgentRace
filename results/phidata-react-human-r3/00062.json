I'll directly provide the implementation in Python.\n\nFinal Answer:\nHere's an implementation of the `derivative` function:\n\n```python\ndef derivative(xs: list):\n    \"\"\" xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.\n    xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....\n    Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.\n    >>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])\n    [1, 4, 12, 20]\n    >>> derivative([1, 2, 3])\n    [2, 6]\n    \"\"\"\n    return [i * xs[i] for i in range(1, len(xs))]\n\n# Examples\nprint(derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]))  # Output: [1, 4, 12, 20]\nprint(derivative([1, 2, 3]))        # Output: [2, 6]\n```\n\nThis code snippet calculates the derivative of a polynomial based on its coefficients. The `derivative` function skips the first coefficient (constant term) and multiplies each coefficient by its respective power of `x`, then returns the derived coefficients as a list.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [6.227766036987305], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [4.483896017074585]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [938], "completion": [318], "total": [1256]}}}

{"query": "\ndef make_a_pile(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.\n    The first level has n stones.\n    The number of stones in the next level is:\n        - the next odd number if n is odd.\n        - the next even number if n is even.\n    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index\n    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> make_a_pile(3)\n    [3, 5, 7]\n    \"\"\"", "answer": "    return [n + 2*i for i in range(n)]", "result": "To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the first level having `n` stones.\n2. Determine whether `n` is odd or even.\n3. Use a loop to fill each subsequent level with stones, where:\n   - If `n` is odd, the next level has the next odd number of stones.\n   - If `n` is even, the next level has the next even number of stones.\n4. Continue this process until all levels are filled.\n5. Return the list representing the number of stones in each level.\n\nWe will implement this logic in the `make_a_pile` function. Let me write the code for this.\nRunning:\n - run_python_code(code=..., variable_to_return=make_a_pile(3))\n\nIt seems I made a minor mistake in returning the value at the end. Let me correctly run the code for the `make_a_pile` function and provide the output.\nRunning:\n - run_python_code(code=..., variable_to_return=result)\n\nThe function works as intended, and when tested with `n = 3`, the result is:\n\n```python\n[3, 5, 7]\n```\n\nThis means the function correctly generates a pile with levels incrementing by 2, based on the given conditions.

{"query": "\n\ndef car_race_collision(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.\n    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars\n    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from\n    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide\n    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.\n    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving\n    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.\n\n    This function outputs the number of such collisions.\n    \"\"\"", "answer": "    return n**2", "result": "To determine the number of collisions in this scenario, consider the following:\n\n1. Since there are `n` cars moving left to right and `n` cars moving right to left, and all cars are moving at the same speed, each pair of left-to-right and right-to-left cars will \"collide\".\n\n2. Since the collisions don't affect the trajectory of the cars, each left-to-right car will collide with each right-to-left car exactly once.\n\nTherefore, for `n` cars going in each direction, there will be a total of `n` collisions. Specifically, each left-to-right car will collide with one corresponding right-to-left car.\n\nLet's summarize this in a function form:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the number of collisions between two groups of cars.\n    \n    Parameters:\n        n (int): The number of cars in each group.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The number of collisions.\n    \"\"\"\n    return n\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output will be 5\n```\n\nThis function simply returns the number of cars `n`, as there will be `n` collisions for `n` cars in each direction.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [25.070323944091797], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [6.945823907852173]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [980], "completion": [257], "total": [1237]}}}

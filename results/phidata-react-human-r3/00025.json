The function uses the smallest divisor (starting with `2`) to repeatedly divide the number `n`, collecting all prime factors in the list `factors`.\n2. Divisors are incremented one by one, but if `divisor * divisor > n` and `n` is still greater than 1, then `n` itself is a prime factor and is appended to the list.\n3. This ensures the function is efficient for large numbers.\n\nYou can copy this and run it to test the behavior for different inputs.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [6.299612998962402], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [4.526774168014526]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [956], "completion": [339], "total": [1295]}}}

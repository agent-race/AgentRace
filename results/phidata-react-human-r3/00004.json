Here's a complete implementation using the `mean_absolute_deviation` function you've started:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\n    around the mean of this dataset.\n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\n    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\n    MAD = average | x - x_mean |\n    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n    1.0\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        return 0.0\n    \n    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n    deviations = [abs(x - mean) for x in numbers]\n    return sum(deviations) / len(numbers)\n\n# Test the function\nprint(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Calculate the Mean:** The mean of the numbers is calculated using `sum(numbers) / len(numbers)`.\n- **Deviation from the Mean:** For each number, we calculate the absolute deviation from the mean and store these in the `deviations` list.\n- **Mean Absolute Deviation:** Finally, we calculate the mean of the absolute deviations, which is the Mean Absolute Deviation.\n\nYou can test it with different data sets to check its correctness.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [6.230815172195435], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [4.713634014129639]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [948], "completion": [334], "total": [1282]}}}

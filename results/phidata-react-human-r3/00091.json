The regular expression `[.?!]` matches any period, question mark, or exclamation point \u2014 which are the delimiters for sentences.\n- **Trimming & Checking:** Use `sentence.strip().startswith('I')` to check if each sentence, after removing leading/trailing whitespace, starts with the character 'I'.\n- **Counting Sentences:** Use `sum(...)` to count the number of sentences that meet the criterion and return this count. \n\nThis solution should work correctly based on the provided criteria.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [7.267219066619873], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.5198681354522705]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [938], "completion": [397], "total": [1335]}}}

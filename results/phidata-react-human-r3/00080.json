For each window, convert the substring to a set (which removes duplicate characters) and check its length. If the length is not 3, it means there are repeated characters, and you return `False`.\n3. **Return True**: If all windows pass the check, return `True`.\n\nThis function covers all test cases as specified in the docstring.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [6.583508014678955], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [4.826684951782227]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [953], "completion": [353], "total": [1306]}}}

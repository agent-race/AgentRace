{"query": "\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\n    \"\"\"Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,\n    deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,\n    and returns the resulted list with a sorted order,\n    The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers,\n    and it may contain duplicates.\n    The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word, and you\n    should return the list sorted by that rule.\n    If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.\n    The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.\n    You may assume that all words will have the same length.\n    For example:\n    assert list_sort([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]) => [\"aa\"]\n    assert list_sort([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]) => [\"ab\", \"cd\"]\n    \"\"\"", "answer": "    lst.sort()\n    new_lst = []\n    for i in lst:\n        if len(i)%2 == 0:\n            new_lst.append(i)\n    return sorted(new_lst, key=len)", "result": "The function `sorted_list_sum` aims to process a list of strings by removing strings with odd lengths, and returning a sorted list. This sorting is based on string lengths, and alphabetically for strings of the same length. Let's implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\n    # Filter out strings with odd lengths\n    even_length_strings = [s for s in lst if len(s) % 2 == 0]\n    \n    # Sort by length, then alphabetically\n    sorted_strings = sorted(even_length_strings, key=lambda x: (len(x), x))\n    \n    return sorted_strings\n\n# Test cases\nassert sorted_list_sum([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]) == [\"aa\"]\nassert sorted_list_sum([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]) == [\"ab\", \"cd\"]\n```\n\nThis function first creates a new list with only the strings of even length from the input `lst`. It then sorts this list first by the length of the strings, and in case of ties, alphabetically. The result is returned as a sorted list of strings.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [5.012795925140381], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [3.5250728130340576]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1018], "completion": [228], "total": [1246]}}}

{"query": "\ndef rounded_avg(n, m):\n    \"\"\"You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the\n    average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). \n    Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.\n    If n is greater than m, return -1.\n    Example:\n    rounded_avg(1, 5) => \"0b11\"\n    rounded_avg(7, 5) => -1\n    rounded_avg(10, 20) => \"0b1111\"\n    rounded_avg(20, 33) => \"0b11010\"\n    \"\"\"", "answer": "    if m < n:\n        return -1\n    summation = 0\n    for i in range(n, m+1):\n        summation += i\n    return bin(round(summation/(m - n + 1)))", "result": "The function `rounded_avg` requires implementation that will compute the average of integers from `n` through `m`, round it to the nearest integer, and return it in binary format.

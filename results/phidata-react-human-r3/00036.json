The result is added to `count`.\n\n4. **Return the count:** After the loop completes, we return the total count.\n\nYou can try running the provided test cases to verify the solution.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [8.221782922744751], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [4.765832901000977]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [910], "completion": [320], "total": [1230]}}}

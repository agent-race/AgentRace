Here's how this can be done:\n\n- Start with `n`.\n- Increment the number of stones for each subsequent level by alternating between the next odd number (if the current number is odd) and the next even number (if the current number is even).\n- Add the number of stones in each level to a list and return it.\n\nHere's the code implementation:\n\n```python\ndef make_a_pile(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.\n    The first level has n stones.\n    The number of stones in the next level is:\n        - the next odd number if n is odd.\n        - the next even number if n is even.\n    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index\n    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> make_a_pile(3)\n    [3, 5, 7]\n    \"\"\"\n    pile = [n]\n    current = n\n    for _ in range(1, n):\n        if current % 2 == 0:  # current is even\n            current += 2  # next even number\n        else:  # current is odd\n            current += 2  # next odd number\n        pile.append(current)\n    return pile\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n```python\nprint(make_a_pile(3))  # Output should be [3, 5, 7]\nprint(make_a_pile(4))  # Output should be [4, 6, 8, 10]\n```", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [19.621767044067383], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [19.601437091827393]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1669], "completion": [355], "total": [2024]}}}

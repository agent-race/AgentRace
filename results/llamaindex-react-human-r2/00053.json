Doctests are a convenient way of embedding tests for your function in its documentation.\n\nIf you want to run these doctests to ensure the function works as expected, you can do this with the `doctest` module in Python.\n\nTo complete and test your code, you can add the body of the function and a block to execute the doctests like this:\n\n```python\ndef add(x: int, y: int):\n    \"\"\"Add two numbers x and y\n    >>> add(2, 3)\n    5\n    >>> add(5, 7)\n    12\n    \"\"\"\n    return x + y\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import doctest\n    doctest.testmod()\n```\n\nWhen you run the script, it will automatically check if the provided examples pass the test.\n\nIf you need help with anything else, let me know!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [24.840983867645264], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [24.821688175201416]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1590], "completion": [208], "total": [1798]}}}

{"query": "\n\ndef car_race_collision(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.\n    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars\n    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from\n    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide\n    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.\n    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving\n    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.\n\n    This function outputs the number of such collisions.\n    \"\"\"", "answer": "    return n**2", "result": "```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving towards each other.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    n (int): The number of cars in each set.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The number of collisions.\n    \"\"\"\n    return n\n```\n\nThis function simply returns \\( n \\), the number of cars in one set, as each car in one set will collide with exactly one car from the other set, resulting in \\( n \\) collisions.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [7.987818956375122], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.969664096832275]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1688], "completion": [272], "total": [1960]}}}

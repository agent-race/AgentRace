I need to implement the logic of the function `starts_one_ends` that calculates the count of `n`-digit positive integers starting or ending with 1.\n \nTo proceed, I will need to:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of `n`-digit integers.\n2. Calculate the number of `n`-digit integers starting with 1.\n3. Calculate the number of `n`-digit integers ending with 1.\n4. Be careful not to double-count integers that both start and end with 1.\n\nLet me now implement this logic in code. \n\nAction: code_interpreter\nAction Input: \n```python\ndef starts_one_ends(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit\n    positive integers that start or end with 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        # Special case: 1-digit numbers mean numbers from 1 to 9\n        return 1  # Only '1' is a 1-digit number that starts or ends with 1\n    \n    # Calculate numbers starting with 1\n    start_with_1 = 10**(n-1)  # 1 followed by (n-1) digits\n    \n    # Calculate numbers ending with 1\n    end_with_1 = 10**(n-1)  # Any digit followed by n-1 other digits\n    \n    # Subtract overlap: numbers both starting and ending with 1\n    both_start_end = 10**(n-2)  # 1 followed by (n-2) digits and ending with 1\n    \n    # Total count is sum of start with 1 and end with 1, minus the overlap\n    return start_with_1 + end_with_1 - both_start_end\n\n# Example use case\nstarts_one_ends(2)\n```", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [7.705481052398682], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.682424068450928]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1581], "completion": [403], "total": [1984]}}}

The `abs()` ensures negative signs are ignored for digit sums.\n\n2. **Sort by Key**:\n   The `sorted` function uses a tuple `(sum_of_digits(x), nums.index(x))` as the key. This ensures the primary sorting is done by the sum of digits, and ties (when two numbers have the same digit sum) are broken by their original order in the `nums` list using `nums.index(x)`.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [11.806511163711548], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [11.790949821472168]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1652], "completion": [314], "total": [1966]}}}

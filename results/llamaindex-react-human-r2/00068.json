If the input array `arr` is empty, the function immediately returns `[]`.\n2. The function loops through the array, checking if the current value is even (`value % 2 == 0`).\n3. It compares the current even value with the smallest even value found so far:\n   - If it's the first even value, the variables `smallest_even` and `smallest_index` are updated.\n   - If the current value is smaller than the previously found smallest value, or if the value is the same but the index is smaller, the variables are updated.\n4. After the loop, if no even value was found, the function returns `[]`. Otherwise, it returns the smallest even value and its index in a list.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [8.900770902633667], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [8.880881071090698]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1849], "completion": [425], "total": [2274]}}}

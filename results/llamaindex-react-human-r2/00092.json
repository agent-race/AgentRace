The `re.split(r'[.!?]', S)` uses a regular expression to split the string `S` into sentences based on delimiters (`.`, `?`, `!`).\n2. Each sentence is stripped of unnecessary whitespace using `.strip()` to prevent spaces from interfering with comparison.\n3. Sentences that start with `\"I\"` are identified using `.startswith(\"I\")`.\n4. A counter (`count`) keeps track of such sentences, and the final value is returned.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [116.93114900588989], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [116.90880393981934]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1644], "completion": [408], "total": [2052]}}}

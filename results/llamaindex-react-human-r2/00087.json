These positions are stored as tuples `(row_index, col_index)`.\n   \n2. **Sorting**:\n   - The outer `key` in sorting ensures that the coordinates are grouped first by row index in ascending order.\n   - The inner sorting `-coord[1]` ensures that column indices are sorted in descending order within each row group.\n\nThis implementation satisfies the requirements of the task.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [99.23972702026367], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [99.21837210655212]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1796], "completion": [645], "total": [2441]}}}

The function uses a simple loop to divide the number by possible divisors starting from 2, appending the divisor to the list each time a division is exact, and repeating the process until `n` is reduced to 1.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [9.073857069015503], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [9.059986114501953]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1662], "completion": [365], "total": [2027]}}}

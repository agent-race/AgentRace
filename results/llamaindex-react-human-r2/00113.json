I can implement a solution for the given task in Python without using external tools.\n\nHere's a function to accomplish the reverse delete task as described:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_delete(s, c):\n    # Remove characters from `s` that are in `c`\n    result_string = ''.join([char for char in s if char not in c])\n    \n    # Check if the result string is a palindrome\n    is_palindrome = result_string == result_string[::-1]\n    \n    # Return the result string and the palindrome check\n    return (result_string, is_palindrome)\n\n# Example test cases\nprint(reverse_delete(\"abcde\", \"ae\"))     # Output should be ('bcd', False)\nprint(reverse_delete(\"abcdef\", \"b\"))     # Output should be ('acdef', False)\nprint(reverse_delete(\"abcdedcba\", \"ab\")) # Output should be ('cdedc', True)\n```\n\nThis function should meet the requirements you've specified for the reverse delete and palindrome check tasks. You can test it with different inputs to ensure it behaves as expected.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [6.659435987472534], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [6.638068199157715]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1699], "completion": [232], "total": [1931]}}}

I need to write a Python function to address the problem statement without using a tool.\n\nTo solve this problem, I'll iterate over the word from right to left and look for a vowel that is sandwiched between two consonants. The conditions specified in the task should be checked during the iteration.\n\nHere's the code implementing the logic:\n\n```python\ndef get_closest_vowel(word):\n    vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n    length = len(word)\n    \n    # Start from the second last character to avoid beginning and ending vowels\n    for i in range(length - 2, 0, -1):\n        if word[i] in vowels and word[i-1] not in vowels and word[i+1] not in vowels:\n            return word[i]\n    return \"\"\n\n# Testing the function\nprint(get_closest_vowel(\"yogurt\"))  # Output: \"u\"\nprint(get_closest_vowel(\"FULL\"))    # Output: \"U\"\nprint(get_closest_vowel(\"quick\"))   # Output: \"\"\nprint(get_closest_vowel(\"ab\"))      # Output: \"\"\n```\n\nThe function employs a loop that starts from the second last character of the word, checks if the current character is a vowel, and ensures that it's between two consonants (non-vowels). If found, it returns this vowel; otherwise, it returns an empty string.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [7.143144130706787], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.123041868209839]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1686], "completion": [303], "total": [1989]}}}

I need to implement the function `count_up_to` that outputs a list of prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer `n`.\nI'll write a Python function to solve this problem.\n\nLet's start by recognizing that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. To find all prime numbers less than `n`, I can create a helper function to check if a number is prime and then build a list of such numbers.\n\nHere's the implementation plan:\n1. Create a helper function `is_prime` to determine if a number is prime.\n2. Iterate through numbers from 2 up to `n`, appending those that are prime to the result list.\n3. Return the result list.\n\nNow, I'll write the code to implement this plan.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [11.21099591255188], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [11.19353199005127]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1682], "completion": [175], "total": [1857]}}}

Start with the smallest prime number, which is `2`.\n2. While the square of the current factor is less than or equal to `n`:\n   - If `n` is divisible by the factor, divide `n` by the factor.\n   - Otherwise, increase the factor to the next possible number.\n3. Once the loop ends, the remaining `n` is the largest prime factor of the original input. \n\nThis is efficient because it reduces `n` as we iterate, ensuring the loop doesn't run unnecessarily for large numbers.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [6.164293050765991], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [6.150223970413208]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1600], "completion": [331], "total": [1931]}}}

If `n` is greater than `m`, the function immediately returns `-1`.\n2. The `sum(range(n, m + 1))` computes the sum of all integers from `n` to `m` (inclusive).\n3. The `count` is the number of integers in the range `[n, m]`, which can be calculated as `(m - n + 1)`.\n4. The average of the range is calculated by dividing the `total_sum` by `count`. The `round` function is used to round the result to the nearest integer.\n5. Finally, the rounded average is converted to its binary representation using Python's `bin` function.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [79.10531187057495], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [79.0856020450592]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1677], "completion": [467], "total": [2144]}}}

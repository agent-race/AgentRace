The user provided a Python function definition and docstring. The function `correct_bracketing` is supposed to check for balanced brackets. I need to implement the function logic to ensure the brackets are correctly matched.\nAction: There's no need to use a tool for this task. I'll directly implement the code.\n\nHere is an implementation for the `correct_bracketing` function:\n\n```python\ndef correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" brackets is a string of \"(\" and \")\".\n    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.\n    >>> correct_bracketing(\"(\")\n    False\n    >>> correct_bracketing(\"()\")\n    True\n    >>> correct_bracketing(\"(()())\")\n    True\n    >>> correct_bracketing(\")(()\")\n    False\n    \"\"\"\n    balance = 0\n    for bracket in brackets:\n        if bracket == '(':\n            balance += 1\n        elif bracket == ')':\n            balance -= 1\n        if balance < 0:\n            return False\n    return balance == 0\n```\n\nThis code uses a counter (`balance`) to keep track of the number of unmatched opening brackets. Every time it encounters an opening bracket, it increments the counter; every time it encounters a closing bracket, it decrements the counter. If the counter ever becomes negative, it means there's a closing bracket without a matching opening bracket, and it returns `False`. Finally, it checks if the counter is zero to ensure all opening brackets have been matched with closing brackets.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [6.517533779144287], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [6.496606111526489]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1626], "completion": [329], "total": [1955]}}}

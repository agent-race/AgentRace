{"query": "\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\n    \"\"\"Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,\n    deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,\n    and returns the resulted list with a sorted order,\n    The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers,\n    and it may contain duplicates.\n    The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word, and you\n    should return the list sorted by that rule.\n    If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.\n    The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.\n    You may assume that all words will have the same length.\n    For example:\n    assert list_sort([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]) => [\"aa\"]\n    assert list_sort([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]) => [\"ab\", \"cd\"]\n    \"\"\"", "answer": "    lst.sort()\n    new_lst = []\n    for i in lst:\n        if len(i)%2 == 0:\n            new_lst.append(i)\n    return sorted(new_lst, key=len)", "result": "Here is the implementation of the function `sorted_list_sum`:\n\n```python\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Accepts a list of strings as a parameter, deletes strings with odd lengths,\n    and returns the resulted list sorted by length and alphabetically for ties.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Filter out strings with odd lengths\n    filtered_lst = [s for s in lst if len(s) % 2 == 0]\n    \n    # Sort the filtered list by length and alphabetically for ties\n    sorted_lst = sorted(filtered_lst, key=lambda x: (len(x), x))\n    \n    return sorted_lst\n\n# Examples:\nprint(sorted_list_sum([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]))  # Output: [\"aa\"]\nprint(sorted_list_sum([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]))  # Output: [\"ab\", \"cd\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Filter odd-length strings:** The function uses a list comprehension to keep only strings with even lengths.\n2. **Sort the list:** The sorting is done using Python's built-in `sorted()` function. The sorting key prioritizes the length of each string and uses lexicographical order for strings with the same length.\n\nYou can test the function with the provided examples or additional test cases to ensure correctness.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [5.501605033874512], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.485821962356567]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1724], "completion": [264], "total": [1988]}}}

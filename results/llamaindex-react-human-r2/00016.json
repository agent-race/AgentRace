The function is partially implemented and requires additional logic to achieve its goal.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n1. Convert the string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity.\n2. Utilize a set to store distinct characters, as sets inherently do not allow duplicates.\n3. Return the size of the set.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\ndef count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\" Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of\n    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')\n    3\n    >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')\n    4\n    \"\"\"\n    return len(set(string.lower()))\n```\n\nThis code snippet accurately counts the distinct characters in the provided string while ignoring the case.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [9.820672988891602], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [9.804697036743164]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [1607], "completion": [193], "total": [1800]}}}

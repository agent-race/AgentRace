If the counter becomes negative during traversal, it means there are unmatched closing brackets (`>`), and the function immediately returns `False`. If, after processing the entire string, the counter is not zero, it means some opening brackets are left unmatched.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [4.885886907577515], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [4.870093107223511]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [756], "completion": [287], "total": [1043]}}}

Positive even numbers have the form \\( 2k \\) where \\( k \\) is a positive integer.\n2. The sum of four positive even numbers would take the form of \\( 2a + 2b + 2c + 2d \\), which simplifies to \\( 2(a + b + c + d) \\). \n\n### Key Considerations:\n- \\( n \\) must be even because the sum of any set of even numbers is also an even number.\n- \\( n \\) must be at least \\( 8 \\), because the smallest possible sum of four positive even numbers is \\( 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 \\).\n\nThus, the function should evaluate if \\( n \\) meets both conditions:\n1. \\( n \\% 2 == 0 \\): \\( n \\) is even.\n2. \\( n \\geq 8 \\): \\( n \\) is large enough to be the sum of four positive even numbers.\n\nHere's the function:\n\n```python\ndef is_equal_to_sum_even(n):\n    \"\"\"Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.\"\"\"\n    return n % 2 == 0 and n >= 8\n```\n\n### Example Usage:\n```python\nprint(is_equal_to_sum_even(4))  # Output: False\nprint(is_equal_to_sum_even(6))  # Output: False\nprint(is_equal_to_sum_even(8))  # Output: True\n```", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [6.140456914901733], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [6.121747970581055]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [740], "completion": [344], "total": [1084]}}}

This simplifies finding the closest pair because we can just look at consecutive pairs.\n2. **Iterating:** After sorting, we calculate the absolute difference between every pair of consecutive elements.\n3. **Tracking Closest Pair:** We keep track of the pair with the smallest difference, updating it whenever a smaller difference is encountered. The result is returned in ascending order.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [4.31347393989563], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [4.299008846282959]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [830], "completion": [436], "total": [1266]}}}

Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\ndef correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:\n    count = 0\n    for bracket in brackets:\n        if bracket == '(':\n            count += 1\n        elif bracket == ')':\n            count -= 1\n        if count < 0:\n            return False\n    return count == 0\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a counter that increments for every opening bracket and decrements for every closing bracket. If at any point the count becomes negative, it means there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, and the function returns `False`. At the end, if the count is not zero, it indicates there are unmatched opening brackets, and the function again returns `False`. If the count is zero, then all brackets are correctly matched.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [9.856852054595947], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [9.840152025222778]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [754], "completion": [206], "total": [960]}}}

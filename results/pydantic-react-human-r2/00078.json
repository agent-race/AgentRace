{"query": "\ndef hex_key(num):\n    \"\"\"You have been tasked to write a function that receives \n    a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal \n    digits that are primes (prime number, or a prime, is a natural number \n    greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers).\n    Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.\n    Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...\n    So you have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, \n    B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13).\n    Note: you may assume the input is always correct or empty string, \n    and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.\n    Examples:\n    For num = \"AB\" the output should be 1.\n    For num = \"1077E\" the output should be 2.\n    For num = \"ABED1A33\" the output should be 4.\n    For num = \"123456789ABCDEF0\" the output should be 6.\n    For num = \"2020\" the output should be 2.\n    \"\"\"", "answer": "    primes = ('2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D')\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(0, len(num)):\n        if num[i] in primes:\n            total += 1\n    return total", "result": "To implement the `hex_key(num)` function, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the set of hexadecimal digits that are considered prime. For hexadecimal digits, the prime numbers are: `2, 3, 5, 7, B(11 in decimal), and D(13 in decimal)`.\n2. Convert the input string to uppercase to ensure it matches hexadecimal digit conventions.\n3. Iterate through each character of the input string to check if the character is in our set of prime hexadecimal digits.\n4. Count how many characters match the prime set.\n5. Return the count.\n\nHere's the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef hex_key(num):\n    # Set of prime hexadecimal digits\n    prime_hex_digits = {'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'}\n    \n    # Count the number of prime hex digits in the input string\n    return sum(1 for char in num if char in prime_hex_digits)\n\n# Examples\nprint(hex_key(\"AB\"))             # Output: 1\nprint(hex_key(\"1077E\"))          # Output: 2\nprint(hex_key(\"ABED1A33\"))       # Output: 4\nprint(hex_key(\"123456789ABCDEF0\")) # Output: 6\nprint(hex_key(\"2020\"))           # Output: 2\n```\n\nThis implementation efficiently checks each character of the input string against the set of prime hexadecimal digits and counts the matches.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [16.93575119972229], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [16.917286157608032]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [962], "completion": [301], "total": [1263]}}}

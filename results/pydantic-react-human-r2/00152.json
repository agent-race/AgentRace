{"query": "\ndef compare(game,guess):\n    \"\"\"I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited\n    event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are\n    definitely worth noting down and comparing.\n    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.\n    You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. \n    Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,\n    the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\n    \n    \n    example:\n\n    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]\n    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]\n    \"\"\"", "answer": "    return [abs(x-y) for x,y in zip(game,guess)]", "result": "The task involves comparing two arrays of numbers, `game` and `guess`, where each index represents the score predicted (`guess`) and the actual score (`game`). The goal is to return an array that calculates how far off each prediction is:\n\n- If the prediction is correct (`game[i] == guess[i]`), the output at that index will be `0`.\n- Otherwise, the output will be the absolute difference: `abs(game[i] - guess[i])`.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef compare(game, guess):\n    return [0 if g == gu else abs(g - gu) for g, gu in zip(game, guess)]\n\n# Examples:\nprint(compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]))  # Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]\nprint(compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]))  # Output: [4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 6]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. Iterate through both `game` and `guess` simultaneously using `zip()`.\n2. For each pair, compare:\n   - If they are equal, append `0` to the result.\n   - Otherwise, append the absolute difference.\n3.

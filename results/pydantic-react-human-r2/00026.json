Note that `numbers.count(num)` may not be very efficient for very large lists since it performs a count operation repeatedly for each element. However, for small-to-moderate-sized lists, it works correctly and keeps the order intact.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [3.792546033859253], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [3.7777810096740723]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [746], "completion": [206], "total": [952]}}}

{"query": "\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\n    \"\"\"Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,\n    deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,\n    and returns the resulted list with a sorted order,\n    The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers,\n    and it may contain duplicates.\n    The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word, and you\n    should return the list sorted by that rule.\n    If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.\n    The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.\n    You may assume that all words will have the same length.\n    For example:\n    assert list_sort([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]) => [\"aa\"]\n    assert list_sort([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]) => [\"ab\", \"cd\"]\n    \"\"\"", "answer": "    lst.sort()\n    new_lst = []\n    for i in lst:\n        if len(i)%2 == 0:\n            new_lst.append(i)\n    return sorted(new_lst, key=len)", "result": "Here's the function definition described in your problem:\n\n```python\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\n    \"\"\"Accepts a list of strings, removes strings with odd lengths, and returns a sorted list.\"\"\"\n    # Filter the list to remove strings with odd lengths\n    even_length_strings = [s for s in lst if len(s) % 2 == 0]\n    \n    # Sort the list first by length, then alphabetically for items with the same length\n    sorted_list = sorted(even_length_strings, key=lambda x: (len(x), x))\n    \n    return sorted_list\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(sorted_list_sum([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]))  # => [\"aa\"]\nprint(sorted_list_sum([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]))  # => [\"ab\", \"cd\"]\n```\n\nThis function:\n1. Filters out strings with odd lengths using a list comprehension.\n2. Sorts the filtered list based on two conditions:\n   - By the length of each string (ascending).\n   - Alphabetically for strings of the same length.\n\nLet me know if you need further explanations or modifications!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [5.2758870124816895], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.257918834686279]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [850], "completion": [232], "total": [1082]}}}

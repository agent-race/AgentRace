{"query": "\n\ndef car_race_collision(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.\n    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars\n    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from\n    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide\n    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.\n    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving\n    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.\n\n    This function outputs the number of such collisions.\n    \"\"\"", "answer": "    return n**2", "result": "This is an interesting scenario that can be tackled theoretically. Let's break this problem down to derive the solution before we implement it.\n\n### Observations:\n1. For simplicity, imagine the cars moving on a 1-dimensional line.\n2. Cars moving left-to-right and those moving right-to-left will pass each other at some point.\n3. All cars are indistinguishable in terms of speed, and no car changes its trajectory after a collision.\n\n### Insight:\nA collision between two cars is defined as a moment when a car moving left-to-right \"hits\" a car moving right-to-left. However, due to the symmetry of motion and the fact that the cars effectively pass through each other without stopping, the number of collisions does not depend on their specific positions or the order of the cars in each set.\n\nFor every car moving left-to-right, it will \"collide\" with each car moving right-to-left exactly once.\n\nThus, the total number of collisions is just:\n\\[ \\text{collisions} = n \\times n = n^2 \\]\n\nThis is because each car in the first set \"collides\" with all the cars in the second set, and there are \\( n \\) cars in each set.\n\n### Implementation:\nLet's now implement this `car_race_collision` function to compute and output the number of collisions based on \\( n \\).\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total number of collisions between two sets of cars\n    moving in opposite directions on an infinite straight road.\n    \n    Parameters:\n        n (int): The number of cars in each set (left-to-right and right-to-left).\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The total number of collisions.\n    \"\"\"\n    return n * n  # Each car in one set collides with every car in the other set\n``` \n\n### Example Usage:\n- Input: `n = 3`\n- Output: \\( 3^2 = 9 \\)\n\nThis gives the correct and optimal result with \\( O(1) \\) time complexity.

Initialize a counter to keep track of how many times the digit `7` appears.\n2. Loop over all integers less than `n`.\n3. Check if each number is divisible by `11` or `13`.\n4. If it is divisible, convert the number to a string and count the occurrences of the digit `7`.\n5. Return the count.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:\n            count += str(i).count('7')\n    return count\n\n# Example function calls\nprint(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0\nprint(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2\nprint(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3\n```\n\nThis implementation checks each number less than `n` for divisibility by `11` or `13`, and then counts the occurrences of `7` in its string representation if the condition is met.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [3.7233619689941406], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [3.7037248611450195]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [742], "completion": [262], "total": [1004]}}}

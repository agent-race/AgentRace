{"query": "\ndef is_bored(S):\n    \"\"\"\n    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number\n    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word \"I\".\n    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.\n   \n    For example:\n    >>> is_bored(\"Hello world\")\n    0\n    >>> is_bored(\"The sky is blue. The sun is shining.

A \"boredom\" is defined as a sentence starting with the word \"I\". A sentence ends at any of the delimiters `.`, `?`, or `!`.\n\nHere's how the function `is_bored(S)` can be implemented in Python to perform the described task:\n\n```python\ndef is_bored(S):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of sentences (delimited by '.', '?' or '!') \n    that start with the word \"I\".\n\n    Parameters:\n        S (str): A string of sentences.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: Number of \"boredoms\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # Split the string into sentences using ., ?, or !\n    sentences = [sentence.strip() for sentence in re.split(r'[.!?]', S)]\n    \n    # Count sentences that start with \"I\" after stripping extra spaces\n    return sum(1 for sentence in sentences if sentence.startswith(\"I\"))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Split by delimiters**: Use the regex `re.split(r'[.!?]', S)` to split the string `S` into sentences whenever it encounters `.` `?` or `!`.\n2. **Strip whitespace**: Use `strip()` to remove any leading or trailing spaces from each sentence after splitting.\n3. **Check for \"I\"**: Check if each cleaned sentence starts with the word `\"I\"`, using `sentence.startswith(\"I\")`.\n4. **Add Results**: Use a generator (`sum()`) to count how many sentences satisfy the described condition.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```python\nprint(is_bored(\"Hello world\"))                           # Output: 0\nprint(is_bored(\"The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather\"))  # Output: 1\nprint(is_bored(\"I am here! What are you doing? I am bored.\"))  # Output: 2\n```\n\nThis will count the sentences beginning with \"I\" correctly.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [24.631749868392944], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [24.61601495742798]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [770], "completion": [421], "total": [1191]}}}

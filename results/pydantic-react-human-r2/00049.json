This can be efficiently computed using the method of modular exponentiation, which allows you to calculate large powers modulo a number efficiently.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef modp(n: int, p: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Return 2^n modulo p using modular exponentiation.\"\"\"\n    result = 1\n    base = 2\n    while n > 0:\n        # If n is odd, multiply the base with the result\n        if n % 2 == 1:\n            result = (result * base) % p\n        # Square the base\n        base = (base * base) % p\n        # Divide n by 2\n        n = n // 2\n    return result\n```\n\nThis uses the approach of right-to-left binary method for modular exponentiation, which is both time and space efficient for large numbers. You iterate over each bit of `n`, squaring the base (which is 2) each time, and multiplying it with the result whenever the current bit of `n` is set (i.e., when `n` is odd).", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [6.784067869186401], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [6.762621879577637]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [769], "completion": [255], "total": [1024]}}}

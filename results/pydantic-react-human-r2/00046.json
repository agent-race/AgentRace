We'll maintain a list or variables to store the previous four values of the sequence.

We handle the base cases for `n` from 0 to 3.\n2. For `n >= 4`, we initialize four variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` to store the previous four elements of the sequence.\n3. We iteratively calculate the current element by summing the previous four elements.\n4. After each calculation, we update the variables to shift forward in the sequence.\n5. Finally, we return the value of `d`, which will hold the n-th element of the sequence after completing the loop.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [5.815556049346924], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.797600984573364]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [833], "completion": [384], "total": [1217]}}}

For instance, the first element is the coefficient of the constant term, the second is for \\(x\\), the third is for \\(x^2\\), and so on.\n\nThe goal is to compute the derivative of the polynomial, which involves multiplying each coefficient by the power of \\(x\\) it corresponds to, and reducing the degree of each term by one. The constant term (xs[0]) will be eliminated since its derivative is 0.\n\nHere\u2019s an implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef derivative(xs: list):\n    \"\"\"Compute the derivative of a polynomial represented by a list of coefficients.\"\"\"\n    return [xs[i] * i for i in range(1, len(xs))]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. `range(1, len(xs))`: We skip the first element (index 0), as its derivative is zero.\n2. `xs[i] * i`: For each coefficient starting from \\(x^1\\), multiply the coefficient by its corresponding power \\(i\\).\n3. The result is a list representing the derivative of the polynomial.\n\n### Examples:\n#### Input: `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`\n- Derivative steps:\n  - Coefficient 1 of \\(x^1\\): \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\)\n  - Coefficient 2 of \\(x^2\\): \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\)\n  - Coefficient 4 of \\(x^3\\): \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\)\n  - Coefficient 5 of \\(x^4\\): \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\)\n- Output: `[1, 4, 12, 20]`\n\n#### Input: `[1, 2, 3]`\n- Derivative steps:\n  - Coefficient 2 of \\(x^1\\): \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\)\n  - Coefficient 3 of \\(x^2\\): \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\)\n- Output: `[2, 6]`", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [9.123934984207153], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [9.10234808921814]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [770], "completion": [468], "total": [1238]}}}

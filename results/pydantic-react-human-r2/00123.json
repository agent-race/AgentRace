{"query": "\ndef get_odd_collatz(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.\n\n    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined\n    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the \n    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of \n    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous\n    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n\n    Note: \n        1. Collatz(1) is [1].\n        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.\n\n    For example:\n    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.\n    \"\"\"", "answer": "    if n%2==0:\n        odd_collatz = [] \n    else:\n        odd_collatz = [n]\n    while n > 1:\n        if n % 2 == 0:\n            n = n/2\n        else:\n            n = n*3 + 1\n            \n        if n%2 == 1:\n            odd_collatz.append(int(n))\n\n    return sorted(odd_collatz)", "result": "To implement the `get_odd_collatz` function, we need to generate the Collatz sequence for a given number \\( n \\), extract the odd numbers from this sequence, and return them in a sorted list. Here's how we can approach this:\n\n1. Initialize the sequence with the starting number, \\( n \\).\n2. Use a loop to continue generating the next term in the sequence.\n3. According to the Collatz conjecture:\n   - If the current term is even, divide it by 2.\n   - If the current term is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1.\n4. Continue until the sequence reaches 1.\n5. Extract the odd numbers from the sequence.\n6.

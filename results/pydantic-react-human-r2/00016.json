Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\" Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of \"\"\"\n    # Convert the string to lowercase to handle case insensitivity\n    string = string.lower()\n    # Use a set to collect distinct characters\n    distinct_characters = set(string)\n    # Return the number of distinct characters\n    return len(distinct_characters)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Output: 3\nprint(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))   # Output: 4\n```\n\nThis function converts the input string to lowercase and then uses a set to store unique characters, since sets inherently do not allow duplicates. Finally, it returns the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct characters.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [3.932900905609131], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [3.9162609577178955]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [736], "completion": [215], "total": [951]}}}

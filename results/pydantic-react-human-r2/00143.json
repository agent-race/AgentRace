It returns `True` if `n` is a prime number, `False` otherwise.\n- **Splitting the Sentence**: The sentence is split into individual words using the `split()` method.\n- **Filtering Words**: A list comprehension is used to create a list of words whose lengths are prime numbers.\n- **Joining Words**: The filtered words are then joined into a single string with spaces between them using `join()`. \n\nThis approach efficiently checks for prime lengths and reconstructs the sentence as required.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [6.2361578941345215], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [6.21765398979187]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [810], "completion": [401], "total": [1211]}}}

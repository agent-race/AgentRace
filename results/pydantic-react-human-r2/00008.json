To implement `sum_product`, we need to calculate the sum and product of all integers in a given list. If the list is empty, the sum should default to `0`, and the product should default to `1`.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.\n    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.\n    >>> sum_product([])\n    (0, 1)\n    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])\n    (10, 24)\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:  # Check if the list is empty\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    total_sum = sum(numbers)\n    total_product = 1\n    for num in numbers:\n        total_product *= num\n\n    return (total_sum, total_product)\n```\n\nThis implementation ensures that:\n1. If the input list is empty, `(0, 1)` is returned as per the requirements.\n2. The sum is calculated using Python's built-in `sum` method.\n3. The product is calculated iteratively by multiplying each number in the list.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [5.04958701133728], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.03424596786499]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [772], "completion": [301], "total": [1073]}}}

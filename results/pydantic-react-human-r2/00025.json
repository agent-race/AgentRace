Start with the smallest prime number, 2, as a divisor.\n2. Check if `n` is divisible by the `divisor`. If it is, divide `n` by `divisor` and add `divisor` to the `factors` list.\n3. Continue dividing `n` by the `divisor` until it's no longer divisible.\n4. Move to the next potential divisor (increment the divisor) and repeat.\n5. The loop continues until the `divisor` is greater than `n`.\n\nThis will result in the list of prime factors for the given number.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {}, "communication_pack": {}, "total_time": [5.0624799728393555], "llm_time": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [5.043187856674194]}, "llm_tokens": {"gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [788], "completion": [373], "total": [1161]}}}

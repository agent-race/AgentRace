Make the Koldsk\u00e5l:**  \n1. In a mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar together until the mixture is pale and creamy.  \n2. Slowly add the buttermilk and yogurt while whisking continuously to create a smooth, creamy mixture.  \n3. Stir in the vanilla, lemon zest, and lemon juice (if using). Mix well and taste to adjust sweetness or tang.  \n4. Chill the Koldsk\u00e5l in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving.\n\n**2. Make the Kammerjunker (if making from scratch):**  \n1. Preheat your oven to 175\u00b0C (350\u00b0F) and line a baking tray with parchment paper.  \n2. In a bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  \n3. Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until fully incorporated.  \n4. In a separate bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, and salt, then gradually add this to the wet ingredients to form a dough.  \n5.

Here are some tips to help you care for your wooden table:\n\n### **1. Regular Cleaning**\n- **Dust Frequently**: Use a soft, lint-free cloth (like microfiber) to dust your table regularly. This prevents the buildup of dirt and grime that can scratch the surface.\n- **Wipe Spills Immediately**: Clean up any liquid spills as soon as possible to prevent stains or water damage. Use a soft, damp cloth and dry the area thoroughly.\n- **Use Mild Cleaning Solutions**: For deeper cleaning, mix a small amount of mild dish soap with warm water. Dampen a cloth (not soaking wet) with the solution and wipe the table, then dry it with a clean towel.\n\n### **2. Protect the Surface**\n- **Use Coasters and Placemats**: Place coasters under glasses and placemats or tablecloths under plates to protect the surface from water rings, heat, and scratches.\n- **Avoid Direct Heat**: Do not place hot dishes, pots, or pans directly on the table. Use trivets or heat-resistant pads to protect the wood.\n- **Minimize Sunlight Exposure**: Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can cause the wood to fade or crack. Position your table away from windows or use curtains/blinds to reduce UV exposure.\n\n### **3. Polish and Condition**\n- **Polish Occasionally**: Use a high-quality furniture polish or wax specifically designed for wooden furniture. Apply it sparingly (a few times a year) to maintain the table's luster and protect the finish.\n- **Condition the Wood**: If your table's wood seems dry, use a wood conditioner or oil (such as linseed or mineral oil) to restore moisture and prevent cracking.\n\n### **4. Prevent Scratches**\n- **Use Felt Pads**: Attach felt pads to the bottom of objects like vases, bowls, or decorative items to avoid scratches.\n- **Avoid Dragging Items**: Lift objects instead of sliding them across the table to prevent gouges or scratches.\n- **Be Mindful with Sharp Objects**: Avoid using knives, scissors, or other sharp tools directly on the table's surface. Use a cutting board when needed.\n\n### **5. Handle Seasonal Changes**\n- **Control Humidity**: Wood can expand and contract with changes in humidity. Keep your home\u2019s humidity levels between 40\u201360% to prevent warping or cracking. Use a humidifier in dry months and a dehumidifier in humid months, if necessary.\n- **Avoid Extreme Temperatures**: Keep the table away from heat sources like radiators or fireplaces, as well as cold drafts.\n\n### **6. Address Damage Promptly**\n- **Remove Stains**: For stubborn stains, gently rub the area with a mixture of baking soda and water or a vinegar solution (test in an inconspicuous area first). Avoid abrasive cleaners.\n- **Repair Scratches**: Use a wood repair kit, furniture touch-up markers, or a matching wood filler to address minor scratches or dents.\n- **Refinish if Necessary**: If the table\u2019s finish is severely worn, consider having it professionally refinished to restore its appearance.\n\n### **7. General Tips**\n- **Avoid Harsh Chemicals**: Stay away from ammonia, bleach, or silicone-based cleaners, as they can damage the wood or its finish.\n- **Rotate Accessories**: Move decorative items like centerpieces occasionally to avoid uneven fading.\n- **Use the Table Gently**: Avoid heavy impacts or leaning on the edges, which could weaken joints or damage the structure.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll preserve the beauty and functionality of your wooden table for years to come!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1051, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1042, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1035, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1051, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2517, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1042, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2610, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1035, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2398, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 1051, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2376, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 1042, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 1689, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 1035, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 2864, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 1051, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 2192, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 1042, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 1986, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 1035, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 2671, "Root Agent_to_Agent 13": 1051, "Agent 13_to_Root Agent": 2556, "Root Agent_to_Agent 14": 1042, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 1994, "Root Agent_to_Agent 15": 1035, "Agent 14_to_Root Agent": 2843, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 2194, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 2591, "Agent 15_to_Root Agent": 2219}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 28, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 30, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 43, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 898, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 31, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 889, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 33, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 882, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 30, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 898, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 31, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 889, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 29, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 882, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 24, "Root Agent_to_Agent 13": 898, "Agent 13_to_Root Agent": 28, "Root Agent_to_Agent 14": 889, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 38, "Root Agent_to_Agent 15": 882, "Agent 14_to_Root Agent": 46, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 40, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 39, "Agent 15_to_Root Agent": 35}, "total_time": [77.78194403648376], "llm_time": {"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.019243001937866, 6.269620895385742, 6.000619888305664, 4.822334051132202, 4.776996850967407], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [6.29991602897644, 4.409543991088867, 3.887181043624878, 3.3556630611419678, 4.753687143325806], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [11.518548965454102, 16.382522106170654, 17.91496181488037, 22.960134983062744, 17.834831953048706], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [37.26595091819763]}, "llm_tokens": {"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [45, 45, 45, 45, 45], "completion": [535, 544, 598, 564, 536], "total": [580, 589, 643, 609, 581]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [39, 39, 39, 39, 39], "completion": [520, 489, 454, 406, 609], "total": [559, 528, 493, 445, 648]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [13, 13, 13, 13, 13], "completion": [380, 448, 522, 603, 502], "total": [393, 461, 535, 616, 515]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [17], "completion": [770], "total": [787]}}}

Fl\u00e6skesteg is a traditional Danish roast pork dish that's often enjoyed during festive occasions. It's known for its crispy crackling and flavorful meat. Here's a classic recipe for Fl\u00e6skesteg:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 2 kg (about 4.4 lbs) pork loin with the skin on\n- 2-3 tablespoons coarse sea salt\n- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n- 4-5 bay leaves\n- 8-10 whole cloves\n- 1-2 cups water\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Preparation:**\n   - Preheat your oven to 200\u00b0C (about 400\u00b0F).\n   - Pat the pork skin dry with paper towels; this helps achieve a crispy crackling.\n\n2. **Scoring the Skin:**\n   - Use a sharp knife to score the pork skin in a cross-hatch pattern, making sure not to cut into the meat. You want the cuts to be about 0.5 cm (\u00bc inch) apart.\n\n3. **Seasoning:**\n   - Rub the scored skin generously with coarse sea salt, ensuring that it gets into the cuts. This not only seasons the meat but also helps to draw moisture from the fat, making the skin crispy. \n   - Sprinkle the ground black pepper over the meat.\n   - Insert bay leaves into some of the cuts in the skin.\n   - Stick cloves into the skin as well, distributing them evenly.\n\n4. **Roasting:**\n   - Place the pork loin on a rack in a roasting pan. This allows air to circulate and helps the skin crisp up.\n   - Pour about 1-2 cups of water into the bottom of the roasting pan. This keeps the meat juicy and helps create a delicious gravy.\n   - Roast in the preheated oven for about 1.5 to 2 hours. The internal temperature of the pork should reach 65\u00b0C (about 149\u00b0F). If the skin isn\u2019t crispy enough, you can increase the oven temperature to 225\u00b0C (about 437\u00b0F) for the last 10-15 minutes.\n\n5. **Resting:**\n   - Once cooked, remove the pork from the oven and let it rest for 15-20 minutes before slicing. This helps the juices redistribute throughout the meat.\n\n6. **Serving:**\n   - Slice the pork and serve with traditional accompaniments like boiled potatoes, pickled red cabbage, and brown gravy from the roasting pan.\n\n### Tips:\n- Make sure to dry the skin thoroughly before adding salt for the best crackling.\n- If the crackling isn\u2019t as crispy as desired, you can use the grill/broiler setting in your oven for a few minutes, but watch closely to prevent burning.\n\nEnjoy your Fl\u00e6skesteg, a centerpiece that\u2019s sure to impress your guests with its flavor and texture!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1240, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1231, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1224, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1240, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2029, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1231, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2117, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1224, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2333, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 1240, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2401, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 1231, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 2515, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 1224, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 2321, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 1240, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2384, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 1231, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 2583, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 1224, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 2344, "Root Agent_to_Agent 13": 1240, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2867, "Root Agent_to_Agent 14": 1231, "Agent 13_to_Root Agent": 2326, "Root Agent_to_Agent 15": 1224, "Agent 14_to_Root Agent": 2375, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 2891, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 2794, "Agent 15_to_Root Agent": 2883}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 43, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 39, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 55, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 898, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 55, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 889, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 54, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 882, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 52, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 898, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 49, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 889, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 53, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 882, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 61, "Root Agent_to_Agent 13": 898, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 55, "Root Agent_to_Agent 14": 889, "Agent 13_to_Root Agent": 41, "Root Agent_to_Agent 15": 882, "Agent 14_to_Root Agent": 58, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 58, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 62, "Agent 15_to_Root Agent": 59}, "total_time": [62.31704497337341], "llm_time": {"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.749825954437256, 3.856640100479126, 7.134263038635254, 6.992002010345459, 6.896039009094238], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [8.835179090499878, 5.3334691524505615, 5.457563161849976, 4.96100378036499, 9.898410081863403], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [15.587625980377197, 24.4875590801239, 24.586066961288452, 21.312026977539062, 23.674078226089478], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.302117824554443]}, "llm_tokens": {"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [86, 86, 86, 86, 86], "completion": [509, 525, 574, 638, 584], "total": [595, 611, 660, 724, 670]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [80, 80, 80, 80, 80], "completion": [608, 648, 672, 648, 601], "total": [688, 728, 752, 728, 681]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [54, 54, 54, 54, 54], "completion": [630, 771, 765, 752, 786], "total": [684, 825, 819, 806, 840]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [58], "completion": [582], "total": [640]}}}

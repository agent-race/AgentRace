It's especially useful for decorating cakes and cupcakes because it holds its shape well. Here's a simple recipe for Crisco frosting:\n\n---\n\n### **Ingredients**\n- 1 cup Crisco (vegetable shortening)\n- 4 cups powdered sugar (sifted, for smooth frosting)\n- 1\u20132 teaspoons vanilla extract (or other flavoring, such as almond or lemon)\n- 2\u20134 tablespoons milk or water (adjust to desired consistency)\n- A pinch of salt (optional, to balance the sweetness)\n- Food coloring (optional, for colored frosting)\n\n---\n\n### **Instructions**\n1. **Cream the Shortening**  \n   In a large mixing bowl, beat the Crisco on medium speed using an electric mixer until it is smooth and creamy.\n\n2. **Add the Sugar**  \n   Gradually add the powdered sugar, about one cup at a time, mixing on low speed at first to prevent a sugar cloud. Once combined, increase the speed to medium and beat until the mixture is fluffy.\n\n3. **Add the Flavoring**  \n   Mix in the vanilla extract (or your choice of flavoring) until fully incorporated.\n\n4. **Adjust the Consistency**  \n   Add the milk or water, one tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition. Continue adding liquid until the frosting reaches your desired consistency. For piping, a thicker consistency is better, while spreading on cakes may require a softer consistency.\n\n5. **Optional: Add Salt and Food Coloring**  \n   If the frosting tastes too sweet, add a pinch of salt and mix well. For colored frosting, add a few drops of food coloring and mix until the color is even.\n\n6. **Beat Until Fluffy**  \n   Beat the frosting on medium-high speed for 2\u20133 minutes until it is light, fluffy, and smooth.\n\n---\n\n### **Tips**\n- **Storage**: If not using immediately, store the frosting in an airtight container at room temperature for a day or in the refrigerator for up to a week. Bring it back to room temperature and re-whip before using.\n- **Stability**: Frosting made with Crisco is more stable than buttercream made with butter, making it ideal for warm or humid conditions.\n- **Flavor Boost**: If you want a richer flavor, you can replace part of the Crisco with butter (e.g., 1/2 cup Crisco and 1/2 cup butter).\n\n---\n\nThis frosting is versatile and works well for cakes, cupcakes, cookies, or any other dessert that needs a smooth and stable topping. Customize it with different flavors and colors to suit your needs!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1046, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1037, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1030, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1046, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2443, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1037, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2426, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1030, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2561, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 1046, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2500, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 1037, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 2581, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 1030, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 2752, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 1046, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 2544, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 1037, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2038, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 1030, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 1959, "Root Agent_to_Agent 13": 1046, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 2514, "Root Agent_to_Agent 14": 1037, "Agent 13_to_Root Agent": 3005, "Root Agent_to_Agent 15": 1030, "Agent 14_to_Root Agent": 2993, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 2294, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 2056, "Agent 15_to_Root Agent": 1914}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 44, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 45, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 41, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 898, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 44, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 889, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 44, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 882, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 50, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 898, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 50, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 889, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 41, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 882, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 41, "Root Agent_to_Agent 13": 898, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 47, "Root Agent_to_Agent 14": 889, "Agent 13_to_Root Agent": 39, "Root Agent_to_Agent 15": 882, "Agent 14_to_Root Agent": 55, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 48, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 43, "Agent 15_to_Root Agent": 41}, "total_time": [64.42836499214172], "llm_time": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [6.425581932067871, 4.336127996444702, 5.274275064468384, 6.816435098648071, 5.176095008850098], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [7.647026062011719, 10.802549123764038, 5.3096020221710205, 5.243650913238525, 6.391914129257202], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [14.833622217178345, 24.433238983154297, 20.79305601119995, 15.740503072738647, 13.997038841247559], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [19.569877862930298]}, "llm_tokens": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [36, 36, 36, 36, 36], "completion": [543, 575, 618, 567, 671], "total": [579, 611, 654, 603, 707]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [42, 42, 42, 42, 42], "completion": [543, 579, 591, 588, 657], "total": [585, 621, 633, 630, 699]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [10, 10, 10, 10, 10], "completion": [494, 492, 567, 539, 476], "total": [504, 502, 577, 549, 486]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [14], "completion": [558], "total": [572]}}}

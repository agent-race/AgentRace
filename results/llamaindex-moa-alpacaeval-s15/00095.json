Here's a classic recipe to get you started:\n\n---\n\n### **Traditional Challah Recipe**\n\n**Ingredients**  \n(Makes 2 medium loaves or 1 large loaf)\n\n- **4 \u00bd tsp active dry yeast** (or 2 packets)\n- **1 cup (240 ml) warm water** (about 110\u00b0F / 45\u00b0C)\n- **1/3 cup (80 ml) honey** (or sugar, for a slightly different flavor)\n- **1/3 cup (80 ml) neutral oil** (like vegetable, canola, or light olive oil)\n- **3 large eggs** (room temperature)\n- **1 \u00bd tsp salt**\n- **4 \u00bd to 5 cups (540\u2013600 g) all-purpose flour** (or bread flour)\n- **1 egg yolk + 1 tbsp water** (for egg wash)\n- Optional: sesame seeds, poppy seeds, or everything bagel seasoning for topping\n\n---\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. **Activate the yeast**  \n   In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm water and honey. Sprinkle the yeast over the top and let it sit for 5\u201310 minutes, until frothy and bubbly.\n\n2. **Mix the wet ingredients**  \n   Add the oil, 2 eggs, 1 egg yolk (reserve the extra white for the egg wash), and salt to the yeast mixture. Stir until well combined.\n\n3. **Add the flour**  \n   Gradually add the flour, 1 cup at a time, mixing after each addition. When the dough starts to come together, transfer it to a lightly floured surface and knead by hand for 8\u201310 minutes (or use a stand mixer with a dough hook for 5\u20137 minutes). The dough should be smooth, elastic, and just slightly sticky. Add small amounts of flour as needed, but avoid over-flouring.\n\n4. **First rise**  \n   Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning it to coat. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free place for 1 \u00bd to 2 hours, or until it doubles in size.\n\n5. **Shape the challah**  \n   Punch down the dough to release air. Divide it into 3, 4, or 6 equal portions, depending on how you'd like to braid your challah. Roll each portion into long ropes of equal length, about 12\u201316 inches. Braid the ropes together and pinch the ends to seal. Place the braided loaf on a parchment-lined baking sheet. If making two smaller loaves, divide the dough in half first and braid each portion.\n\n6. **Second rise**  \n   Cover the braided loaf loosely with a towel and let it rise for another 30\u201345 minutes, until puffy.\n\n7. **Preheat the oven**  \n   While the loaf is rising, preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).\n\n8. **Apply the egg wash**  \n   In a small bowl, whisk together the reserved egg white with 1 tablespoon of water. Gently brush the egg wash over the challah, making sure to get into the crevices. Sprinkle with seeds or toppings, if desired.\n\n9. **Bake**  \n   Bake the challah in the preheated oven for 25\u201330 minutes (for medium loaves) or 30\u201335 minutes (for a large loaf), until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. If the top is browning too quickly, tent it with foil.\n\n10. **Cool and enjoy**  \n    Let the challah cool on a wire rack before slicing. Serve plain, with butter, or use it for French toast!\n\n---\n\nEnjoy your homemade challah!

Canjeero, also known as Injera in Ethiopia and Eritrea, is a traditional Somali flatbread that is often enjoyed for breakfast or as a side dish. It has a spongy texture and a slightly tangy flavor. Here\u2019s a simple recipe to make Canjeero:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 2 cups of all-purpose flour\n- 1 cup of fine semolina flour (or cornmeal if unavailable)\n- 1/2 cup of self-rising flour\n- 1 teaspoon of active dry yeast\n- 1 teaspoon of sugar\n- 1/2 teaspoon of salt\n- 4 cups of warm water (approximately)\n- Oil for cooking (optional)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Batter:**\n   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, self-rising flour, yeast, sugar, and salt.\n   - Gradually add the warm water while stirring continuously to avoid lumps. The batter should be smooth and slightly thinner than pancake batter.\n   - Cover the bowl with a clean cloth or plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for about 1-2 hours. This allows the yeast to ferment and the batter to develop a tangy flavor.\n\n2. **Cook the Canjeero:**\n   - Preheat a non-stick skillet or a flat frying pan over medium heat. Lightly oil the pan if needed.\n   - Stir the batter gently and pour a ladleful onto the skillet, starting in the center and spiraling outward to form a thin, even layer.\n   - Cook the Canjeero until bubbles form on the surface and the edges start to lift, about 2-3 minutes. You do not need to flip it; it\u2019s cooked on one side only.\n   - Remove the Canjeero from the pan and place it on a plate. Cover with a clean cloth to keep it warm.\n   - Repeat the process with the remaining batter, stirring it occasionally to keep it well-mixed.\n\n3. **Serve:**\n   - Canjeero is traditionally served with a drizzle of butter and honey, or with savory sides like stews, meats, or scrambled eggs.\n   - Enjoy it warm for the best taste and texture.\n\nFeel free to experiment with the thickness and cooking time to achieve your preferred texture. Canjeero is versatile and can be paired with a variety of toppings and dishes.

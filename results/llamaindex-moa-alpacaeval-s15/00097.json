Tong Sui, which means \"sugar water\" in Cantonese, is a category of sweet soups and desserts popular in Hong Kong and southern China. One of the classic Tong Sui recipes is **Sweet Red Bean Soup**. It's comforting, easy to make, and perfect for serving to guests. Here's a recipe for you:\n\n---\n\n### **Sweet Red Bean Soup (Hong Kong-style Tong Sui)**\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 1 cup dried red beans (adzuki beans)\n- 6 cups water\n- 1/4 cup granulated sugar (adjust to taste)\n- 2-3 pandan leaves (optional, for fragrance)\n- 1/8 cup glutinous rice or dried lotus seeds (optional, for added texture)\n- Coconut milk (optional, for richness)\n- Pinch of salt\n\n---\n\n#### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the red beans**:\n   - Rinse the dried red beans thoroughly under cold water to remove any impurities.\n   - Soak the beans in water for 4-6 hours or overnight to shorten the cooking time. If you're short on time, you can skip soaking, but the beans may take longer to soften.\n\n2. **Cook the beans**:\n   - Drain the soaked beans and transfer them to a pot.\n   - Add 6 cups of water and bring to a boil over medium heat.\n   - Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 1-1.5 hours, or until the beans are soft and slightly broken down. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.\n\n3. **Add pandan leaves and optional ingredients**:\n   - If using pandan leaves, tie them into a knot and add them to the pot while the beans are simmering. They will infuse a subtle, fragrant aroma.\n   - If you want extra texture, add the glutinous rice or lotus seeds during the last 30 minutes of cooking.\n\n4. **Sweeten the soup**:\n   - Once the beans are soft, add granulated sugar to the pot. Stir well to dissolve.\n   - Taste the soup and adjust the sweetness as needed. Add a pinch of salt to balance the flavors.\n\n5. **Optional coconut milk**:\n   - For a creamier version, swirl in a few tablespoons of coconut milk at the end. It adds richness and a tropical touch.\n\n6. **Serve**:\n   - Remove the pandan leaves before serving.\n   - Ladle the red bean soup into bowls and enjoy it warm or chilled, depending on your preference.\n\n---\n\n### Tips:\n- If you prefer a smoother consistency, use a blender or immersion blender to partially puree the soup. This creates a thicker texture while still retaining some whole beans.\n- Sweet Red Bean Soup can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Simply reheat before serving.\n\n---\n\nTong Sui is versatile, and there are many other varieties, such as black sesame soup, almond soup, or taro and tapioca dessert.

Clean the cage once a week and replace the bedding every few weeks. Finally, keep an eye out for signs of illness like sneezing, weight loss, or aggressive behavior.", "result": "assistant: Keeping a rat as a pet can be a rewarding experience, as they are intelligent, social animals. Here's a guide to help you house, feed, and care for your pet rat:\n\n### Housing:\n\n1. **Cage**: \n   - Choose a spacious cage with solid floors and multiple levels to allow your rat to climb and explore. Wire cages with horizontal bars are ideal as they provide ventilation and areas for climbing.\n   - Minimum recommended size is about 2 cubic feet per rat.\n   - Ensure the bars are close enough to prevent escape, generally no more than \u00bd inch apart.\n\n2. **Bedding**:\n   - Use paper-based bedding or aspen shavings. Avoid cedar and pine shavings as they can be harmful to rats.\n   - Clean the bedding regularly, ideally once a week, to maintain a hygienic environment.\n\n3. **Accessories**:\n   - Provide hiding places like tunnels or small boxes.\n   - Include chew toys to help wear down their teeth, which continuously grow.\n   - Add a water bottle and a food dish.\n\n### Feeding:\n\n1. **Diet**:\n   - Offer a balanced diet consisting of high-quality lab blocks or pellets supplemented with fresh fruits and vegetables.\n   - Avoid giving them sugary or fatty foods and limit treats.\n   - Fresh water should always be available.\n\n2. **Foods to Avoid**:\n   - Stay away from chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, and sticky foods that can be harmful to rats.\n\n### Care:\n\n1. **Socializing**:\n   - Rats are social creatures and do well in pairs or small groups, especially same-sex pairs to avoid breeding.\n   - Spend time handling and interacting with your rat daily to build trust and strengthen your bond.\n\n2. **Health**:\n   - Regularly check for signs of illness such as lethargy, respiratory issues, or skin problems.\n   - Find a vet experienced with rodents for regular health check-ups or if any issues arise.\n\n3. **Enrichment**:\n   - Provide toys, puzzles, and opportunities for exploration to keep their minds active.\n   - Allow supervised playtime outside the cage in a safe area.\n\n4. **Cleanliness**:\n   - Clean the cage weekly, and spot clean soiled areas daily.\n   - Wash food dishes and water bottles frequently to prevent bacterial growth.\n\nBy providing proper housing, a balanced diet, and regular social interaction, you'll create a healthy and happy environment for your pet rat.

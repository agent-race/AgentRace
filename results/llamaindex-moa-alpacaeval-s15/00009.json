Kubdari is a traditional Georgian dish, specifically from the Svaneti region. It's a flavorful meat-filled bread with a mix of spices that make it truly special. Here's a recipe to help you prepare this delicious dish at home:\n\n---\n\n### **Kubdari (Georgian Meat-Filled Bread)**\n\n#### **Ingredients**\n\n**For the Dough:**\n- 500g (4 cups) all-purpose flour\n- 1 tsp salt\n- 1 tsp sugar\n- 7g (1 packet) dry yeast\n- 250ml (1 cup) warm milk\n- 2 tbsp vegetable oil or melted butter\n- 1 egg (optional, for a richer dough)\n\n**For the Filling:**\n- 500g (1 lb) beef, pork, or a mix of both (finely chopped or ground)\n- 2 medium onions (finely chopped)\n- 3 garlic cloves (minced)\n- 1 tsp ground coriander\n- 1 tsp ground fenugreek (blue fenugreek, if available)\n- 1 tsp smoked paprika\n- 1 tsp ground cumin\n- 1 tsp salt (adjust to taste)\n- \u00bd tsp black pepper\n- \u00bd tsp chili flakes (optional, for heat)\n- Fresh cilantro, parsley, or dill (chopped, optional)\n\n**For Assembly:**\n- Flour for dusting\n- Butter (melted, for brushing)\n\n---\n\n#### **Instructions**\n\n1. **Prepare the Dough:**\n   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm milk, sugar, and yeast. Let the mixture sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy (to activate the yeast).\n   - Add the salt, vegetable oil (or melted butter), and egg (if using). Gradually add the flour, mixing until a soft dough forms.\n   - Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 8-10 minutes until it\u2019s smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-1.5 hours, or until it doubles in size.\n\n2. **Prepare the Filling:**\n   - In a large bowl, mix the chopped or ground meat with onions, garlic, coriander, fenugreek, paprika, cumin, salt, black pepper, and chili flakes. Add fresh herbs if desired. Mix well to combine.\n\n3. **Assemble the Kubdari:**\n   - Preheat your oven to 200\u00b0C (400\u00b0F). If you have a pizza stone or baking steel, place it in the oven to preheat as well.\n   - Punch down the dough and divide it into 4 equal portions (or 2 portions for larger Kubdari).\n   - Roll out each portion into a circle, about 20 cm (8 inches) in diameter.\n   - Place a generous amount of filling (about 1/4 of the mixture) in the center of the dough circle. Gather the edges of the dough over the filling to form a pouch, pinching the seams together tightly.\n   - Gently flatten the dough ball with your hands to form a round, filled bread. Be careful not to tear the dough.\n\n4. **Bake:**\n   - Place the Kubdari on a parchment-lined baking sheet (or directly on the preheated pizza stone for a crispier crust).\n   - Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and the filling is cooked through.\n   - Optional: Brush the hot Kubdari with melted butter for extra flavor and a shiny finish.\n\n5. **Serve:**\n   - Let the Kubdari cool slightly before slicing. Serve warm and enjoy this hearty, flavorful Georgian dish with friends and family!\n\n---\n\nKubdari pairs beautifully with a fresh salad, pickled vegetables, or even a glass of Georgian wine.

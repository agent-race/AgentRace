Milanesa de peceto is a delicious and popular Argentinian dish that's perfect for hosting guests. It consists of thinly sliced beef that's breaded and fried, similar to a schnitzel. Here's a recipe for Milanesa de Peceto:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 1 kg (about 2.2 lbs) beef peceto (eye of round), sliced into thin steaks\n- 3-4 eggs\n- 2 cups bread crumbs\n- 1 cup all-purpose flour\n- 2 cloves garlic, finely minced\n- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Vegetable oil for frying\n- Lemon wedges for serving\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Meat:**\n   - Slice the beef peceto into thin steaks, about 1/4 inch thick. If they are too thick, you can gently pound them with a meat mallet to flatten them.\n\n2. **Season:**\n   - In a shallow dish, crack the eggs and beat them with a fork or whisk. Add the minced garlic, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix well.\n\n3. **Bread the Meat:**\n   - Place the flour in another shallow dish. Dredge each steak in the flour, shaking off the excess.\n   - Dip the floured steak into the egg mixture, ensuring it's well coated.\n   - Finally, press the steak into the bread crumbs, covering it completely. You can press down to make sure the crumbs adhere well.\n\n4. **Fry the Milanesas:**\n   - Heat the vegetable oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. You'll need enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan generously.\n   - Once the oil is hot (but not smoking), add the breaded steaks. Fry them for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy. Avoid overcrowding the pan; cook in batches if necessary.\n\n5. **Drain and Serve:**\n   - Remove the milanesas from the pan and place them on paper towels to drain excess oil.\n   - Serve hot with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over the milanesas. \n\n### Tips:\n- You can also bake the milanesas in a preheated oven at 200\u00b0C (about 400\u00b0F) for a healthier option. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for about 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through.\n- Milanesas can be served with a variety of sides, such as mashed potatoes, salad, or French fries.\n\nEnjoy your Argentinian culinary adventure with Milanesa de Peceto!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1252, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1243, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1236, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1252, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2103, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1243, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2006, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1236, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2087, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 1252, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2401, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 1243, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2399, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 1236, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 2662, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 1252, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 1969, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 1243, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 3096, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 1236, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 2066, "Root Agent_to_Agent 13": 1252, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 1917, "Root Agent_to_Agent 14": 1243, "Agent 14_to_Root Agent": 2102, "Root Agent_to_Agent 15": 1236, "Agent 13_to_Root Agent": 2063, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 2638, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 2781, "Agent 15_to_Root Agent": 2559}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 53, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 41, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 47, "Root Agent_to_Agent 7": 898, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 53, "Root Agent_to_Agent 8": 889, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 59, "Root Agent_to_Agent 9": 882, "Agent 8_to_Root Agent": 68, "Root Agent_to_Agent 10": 898, "Agent 7_to_Root Agent": 50, "Root Agent_to_Agent 11": 889, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 58, "Root Agent_to_Agent 12": 882, "Agent 11_to_Root Agent": 42, "Root Agent_to_Agent 13": 898, "Agent 10_to_Root Agent": 43, "Root Agent_to_Agent 14": 889, "Agent 14_to_Root Agent": 54, "Root Agent_to_Agent 15": 882, "Agent 13_to_Root Agent": 33, "Agent 9_to_Root Agent": 62, "Agent 12_to_Root Agent": 57, "Agent 15_to_Root Agent": 51}, "total_time": [48.1459219455719], "llm_time": {"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.51172399520874, 5.418200969696045, 5.3349010944366455, 5.760374069213867, 6.69259786605835], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [12.118703126907349, 9.111196041107178, 4.914748907089233, 5.329505920410156, 4.365228176116943], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [12.195964097976685, 17.430706024169922, 23.114034175872803, 14.761343955993652, 12.799429893493652], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.559814214706421]}, "llm_tokens": {"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [89, 89, 89, 89, 89], "completion": [494, 486, 518, 486, 529], "total": [583, 575, 607, 575, 618]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [83, 83, 83, 83, 83], "completion": [503, 595, 651, 492, 533], "total": [586, 678, 734, 575, 616]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [56, 56, 56, 56, 56], "completion": [635, 762, 684, 689, 659], "total": [691, 818, 740, 745, 715]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [60], "completion": [539], "total": [599]}}}

It is traditionally used as a garnish to add a burst of fresh, zesty flavor to dishes, particularly rich or hearty ones. Gremolata is most famously paired with *osso buco alla milanese* (braised veal shanks), where it brightens and balances the richness of the dish.\n\nWhile the traditional recipe uses only parsley, garlic, and lemon zest, variations may include ingredients like olive oil, anchovies, or other herbs to suit different tastes and dishes. Gremolata is versatile and can also be used as a topping for roasted vegetables, grilled meats, seafood, or even pasta. Its fresh, vibrant flavor makes it a popular choice in many cuisines for adding a final touch to a dish.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1032, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1023, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1016, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1032, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 1111, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1023, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 1018, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1016, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 974, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 1216, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 1234, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 1315}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 21, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 24, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 23, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 19, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 28, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 30}, "total_time": [24.648786067962646], "llm_time": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [2.955458879470825, 2.837752103805542], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [3.3028171062469482, 3.457921028137207], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [12.690335035324097, 16.709975004196167], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [4.597784042358398]}, "llm_tokens": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [36, 36], "completion": [251, 257], "total": [287, 293]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [42, 42], "completion": [216, 215], "total": [258, 257]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [10, 10], "completion": [299, 334], "total": [309, 344]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [14], "completion": [175], "total": [189]}}}

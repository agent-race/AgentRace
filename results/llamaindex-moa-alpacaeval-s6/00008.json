Here are some suggestions for how you might divide your drawers:\n\n1. **Underwear Drawer**: Use this drawer for storing underwear, bras, and socks. You might consider using dividers to keep everything neatly separated.\n\n2. **T-Shirt Drawer**: This drawer can be for casual tops, including t-shirts and tank tops. Roll or fold them to maximize space.\n\n3. **Pants and Shorts Drawer**: Store jeans, trousers, leggings, and shorts here. You can fold them or use a file-folding method to save space.\n\n4. **Sweaters and Hoodies Drawer**: Dedicate a drawer to bulkier items like sweaters, hoodies, and sweatshirts. If space is limited, consider storing out-of-season items elsewhere.\n\n5. **Activewear Drawer**: Keep all your workout gear, like leggings, sports bras, and gym tops, together for easy access.\n\n6. **Sleepwear Drawer**: Store pajamas, nightgowns, and loungewear in a dedicated drawer.\n\n7. **Seasonal/Occasional Wear Drawer**: Use this drawer for items you don\u2019t wear often, like swimsuits, holiday sweaters, or formal wear accessories.\n\n8. **Accessories Drawer**: If you have space, you might dedicate a drawer to accessories like scarves, belts, and hats.\n\n9. **Specialty Clothing Drawer**: This could be for items like shapewear, slips, or special undergarments.\n\n10. **Drawer for Small Items**: Use this for items like handkerchiefs, bandanas, or small bags.\n\nUsing drawer organizers, baskets, or dividers can further enhance the organization and accessibility of your clothing.

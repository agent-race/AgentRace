It's flavorful and aromatic, featuring a blend of spices and meat. Here's a recipe for making Kubdari:\n\n### Ingredients\n\n#### For the Dough:\n- 500g all-purpose flour\n- 1 packet (7g) dry yeast\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n- 1 teaspoon sugar\n- 250ml warm water\n- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n\n#### For the Filling:\n- 500g beef or pork (or a mix of both), finely chopped or minced\n- 1 large onion, finely chopped\n- 2-3 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 teaspoon ground coriander\n- 1 teaspoon dried fenugreek\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n- 1 teaspoon black pepper\n- 1 teaspoon paprika\n- 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped\n- Optional: chili flakes for some heat\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### Making the Dough:\n1. **Activate the Yeast:** In a small bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until frothy.\n\n2. **Mix the Dough:** In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Add the activated yeast mixture and vegetable oil to the flour. Mix until a dough forms.\n\n3. **Knead the Dough:** Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.\n\n4. **Let it Rise:** Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean cloth or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, until doubled in size.\n\n#### Preparing the Filling:\n1. **Combine Ingredients:** In a large bowl, mix the chopped meat, onion, garlic, coriander, fenugreek, salt, pepper, paprika, parsley, and chili flakes (if using).\n\n2. **Mix Well:** Ensure all ingredients are well combined. If using minced meat, consider mixing with your hands to blend the spices thoroughly.\n\n#### Assembling the Kubdari:\n1. **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 200\u00b0C (400\u00b0F).\n\n2. **Roll Out the Dough:** Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into equal portions (usually 2-4 pieces, depending on desired size).\n\n3. **Fill the Dough:** Roll out each portion into a circle. Place a generous amount of filling in the center.\n\n4. **Seal the Bread:** Gather the edges of the dough over the filling and pinch together to seal, forming a round or oval-shaped bread. Flatten gently with your hands.\n\n5. **Bake:** Place the filled dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until golden brown.\n\n6. **Serve:** Allow to cool slightly before slicing. Serve warm, ideally with a side of Georgian salad or pickles.\n\nEnjoy your homemade Kubdari, a taste of Georgian cuisine!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1239, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1230, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1223, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1239, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2097, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1230, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2342, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1223, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2451, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2052, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2776, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2765}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 51, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 40, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 45, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 52, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 62, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 64}, "total_time": [36.86387920379639], "llm_time": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.149780988693237, 3.9345619678497314], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.245599031448364, 5.845160007476807], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [23.579998016357422, 24.488866090774536], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.103594064712524]}, "llm_tokens": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [79, 79], "completion": [522, 512], "total": [601, 591]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [85, 85], "completion": [588, 617], "total": [673, 702]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [53, 53], "completion": [733, 726], "total": [786, 779]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [57], "completion": [625], "total": [682]}}}

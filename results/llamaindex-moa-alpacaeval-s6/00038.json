Here's an easy recipe to make your own tahini at home:\n\n---\n\n**Homemade Tahini Recipe**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 1 cup sesame seeds (hulled white sesame seeds are ideal)\n- 2\u20134 tablespoons neutral oil (e.g., grapeseed oil, vegetable oil, or light olive oil)\n- Pinch of salt (optional)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Toast the Sesame Seeds**:\n   Heat a dry skillet over medium heat and add the sesame seeds. Stir frequently to prevent burning, and toast them until they become fragrant and lightly golden (about 3\u20135 minutes). Be careful not to over-toast them, as this can make the tahini taste bitter.\n\n2. **Cool the Seeds**:\n   Remove the toasted sesame seeds from the skillet and let them cool for a few minutes.\n\n3. **Blend the Seeds**:\n   Place the cooled sesame seeds in a food processor or high-speed blender and start blending. The seeds will first turn into a crumbly texture.\n\n4. **Add Oil**:\n   Gradually drizzle in the oil while continuing to blend. Blend until the mixture becomes smooth and creamy. You can adjust the amount of oil depending on your desired consistency.\n\n5. **Season (Optional)**:\n   Add a pinch of salt if you like, and blend again briefly.\n\n6. **Store**:\n   Transfer the tahini to an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator for up to a month.\n\n---\n\nTahini can be used for dips, sauces, or as a spread.

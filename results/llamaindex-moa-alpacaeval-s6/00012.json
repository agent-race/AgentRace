Canjeero (also spelled as Lahooh or Injera in some regions) is a soft, spongy, and pancake-like flatbread that is a staple in Somali cuisine. It\u2019s traditionally served for breakfast or alongside stews and dishes. Here's a simple recipe for making Canjeero:\n\n---\n\n### **Canjeero Recipe**  \n**Servings:** Makes about 8\u201310 Canjeero  \n\n---\n\n### **Ingredients**  \n- 2 cups all-purpose flour (or substitute with a mix of white flour and whole wheat flour)  \n- 1 cup fine semolina (optional, but it adds a nice texture)  \n- 2 teaspoons sugar  \n- 1 teaspoon salt  \n- 1 teaspoon dry active yeast  \n- 2 \u00bd cups lukewarm water (adjust as needed for consistency)  \n- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil (optional, for cooking)  \n\n---\n\n### **Instructions**  \n\n1. **Prepare the Batter:**  \n   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, semolina (if using), sugar, salt, and dry active yeast.  \n   - Gradually add the lukewarm water while whisking or mixing with your hands to avoid lumps. The batter should have a thin, pourable consistency, similar to pancake batter.  \n   - Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and allow the batter to ferment. Let it sit in a warm spot for about 2\u20134 hours, or until bubbles form on the surface. Fermentation is key to creating the spongy texture.\n\n2. **Cooking the Canjeero:**  \n   - Heat a non-stick skillet or flat griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease the surface with a small amount of vegetable oil if necessary.  \n   - Stir the batter gently, then pour about \u00bd cup of batter onto the skillet, swirling it in a circular motion to form a thin, round pancake.  \n   - Cook the Canjeero on one side only. You\u2019ll notice bubbles forming on the surface as it cooks\u2014this is a signature feature of Canjeero. Once the surface is set and the bottom is lightly golden, remove it from the skillet. *It should only take about 1\u20132 minutes per Canjeero.*  \n   - Repeat with the remaining batter.\n\n3. **Serve:**  \n   - Canjeero is best served warm. Traditionally, it is eaten with a drizzle of sesame oil, a sprinkle of sugar, or alongside stews, meats, or Somali tea (Shaah).  \n\n---\n\n### **Tips for Success**  \n- If you don\u2019t see bubbles forming during cooking, the batter may be too thick. Add a little more water to thin it out.  \n- For a more authentic flavor, some recipes use a small amount of sourdough starter or let the batter ferment overnight.  \n- Store leftover Canjeero in an airtight container or plastic bag to keep it soft. You can reheat it briefly in the skillet before serving.\n\n---\n\nEnjoy hosting your guests with this delightful Somali flatbread! \ud83d\ude0a", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1238, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1229, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1222, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1238, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2505, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1229, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2482, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1222, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2329, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2409, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2480, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2395}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 47, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 36, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 48, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 50, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 51, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 47}, "total_time": [46.14932703971863], "llm_time": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.539280891418457, 8.96065902709961], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [6.493581771850586, 8.217478036880493], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [24.28334093093872, 21.198395013809204], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [18.41871213912964]}, "llm_tokens": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [79, 79], "completion": [613, 583], "total": [692, 662]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [85, 85], "completion": [606, 578], "total": [691, 663]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [53, 53], "completion": [647, 613], "total": [700, 666]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [57], "completion": [625], "total": [682]}}}

Here's a classic recipe for you to try:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- **4 to 4 \u00bd cups** all-purpose flour\n- **1 packet** (2 \u00bc teaspoons) active dry yeast\n- **1 cup** warm water (about 110\u00b0F or 43\u00b0C)\n- **\u00bc cup** honey\n- **\u00bc cup** vegetable oil\n- **2 large eggs**\n- **2 teaspoons** salt\n\n### For the Egg Wash:\n- **1 egg yolk**\n- **1 tablespoon** water\n\n### Optional Toppings:\n- Poppy seeds or sesame seeds\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Activate the Yeast:**\n   - In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water. Stir in the honey and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes foamy.\n\n2. **Mix the Dough:**\n   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the yeast mixture with the oil, eggs, and salt. Gradually add 4 cups of flour, one cup at a time, mixing after each addition. The dough should start to come together but still be slightly sticky.\n\n3. **Knead the Dough:**\n   - Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Knead for about 8-10 minutes, adding more flour as needed, until the dough is smooth and elastic. You can also use a stand mixer with a dough hook for this step.\n\n4. **First Rise:**\n   - Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning it to coat all sides. Cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place until it doubles in size, about 1 to 2 hours.\n\n5. **Shape the Challah:**\n   - Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into three equal pieces (or more, depending on the braid style you prefer). Roll each piece into a rope about 12-16 inches long. Braid the ropes together, pinching the ends to seal.\n\n6. **Second Rise:**\n   - Place the braided loaf on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover it loosely with a towel and let it rise again until it\u2019s puffy, about 30-45 minutes.\n\n7. **Preheat the Oven:**\n   - Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).\n\n8. **Prepare the Egg Wash:**\n   - In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and water. Brush this mixture over the challah loaf. Sprinkle with seeds, if desired.\n\n9. **Bake:**\n   - Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. If it browns too quickly, you can tent it with foil.\n\n10. **Cool:**\n    - Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack before slicing.\n\nEnjoy your homemade challah! It's perfect for any special meal or can simply be enjoyed as a delicious treat.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1087, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1078, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1071, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1087, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2752, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1078, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2567, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1071, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2961, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2858, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2461, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2965}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 44, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 56, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 46, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 56, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 63, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 57}, "total_time": [34.138084173202515], "llm_time": {"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [6.895977020263672, 7.791738986968994], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [7.232115030288696, 5.200121879577637], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [23.158293962478638, 19.105566024780273], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [7.77190899848938]}, "llm_tokens": {"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [56, 56], "completion": [676, 724], "total": [732, 780]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [50, 50], "completion": [683, 732], "total": [733, 782]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [24, 24], "completion": [688, 769], "total": [712, 793]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [27], "completion": [645], "total": [672]}}}

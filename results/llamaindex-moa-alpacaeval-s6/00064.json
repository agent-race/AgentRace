They\u2019re flaky, cheesy, and utterly delicious. Here's a recipe to get you started:\n\n---\n\n### **Israeli Cheese Bourekas Recipe**\n**Servings:** Makes about 12 bourekas  \n**Prep Time:** 20 minutes  \n**Cook Time:** 25 minutes  \n**Total Time:** 45 minutes  \n\n#### **Ingredients:**\n- **1 package (1 lb)** frozen puff pastry, thawed\n- **1 cup** crumbled feta cheese (or a mix of feta and ricotta for a milder flavor)\n- **\u00bd cup** grated mozzarella cheese (optional, for extra gooeyness)\n- **1 large egg**, lightly beaten (for the filling)\n- **1 egg yolk**, beaten (for brushing the pastry tops)\n- **1 tablespoon** sour cream (optional, for creamier filling)\n- **1 teaspoon** dried oregano or za\u2019atar (optional, for added flavor)\n- **Sesame seeds** or nigella seeds (optional, for garnish)\n\n#### **Instructions:**\n\n1. **Preheat the oven:**  \n   Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n\n2. **Prepare the cheese filling:**  \n   In a mixing bowl, combine the crumbled feta, grated mozzarella (if using), beaten egg, sour cream (optional), and dried oregano or za\u2019atar. Mix well until the filling is uniform.\n\n3. **Roll out the puff pastry:**  \n   On a lightly floured surface, roll out the thawed puff pastry sheets. Cut the pastry into squares (approximately 4x4 inches) or circles, depending on your preferred shape for the bourekas.\n\n4. **Fill the pastry:**  \n   Place a small spoonful of the cheese mixture in the center of each pastry square. Be careful not to overfill, as it can leak out while baking.\n\n5. **Shape the bourekas:**  \n   Fold the pastry over the filling to create a triangle or half-moon shape (depending on whether you used squares or circles). Press the edges firmly together to seal, and crimp them with a fork for extra security and decoration.\n\n6. **Brush and garnish:**  \n   Place the bourekas on the prepared baking sheet. Brush the tops with the beaten egg yolk. Sprinkle sesame seeds or nigella seeds on top for added texture and flavor.\n\n7. **Bake:**  \n   Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the bourekas are golden brown and puffed up.\n\n8. **Serve:**  \n   Allow the bourekas to cool slightly before serving. Serve them warm or at room temperature alongside a fresh Israeli salad, tahini dip, or your favorite drink!\n\n---\n\n### **Tips for Hosting with Bourekas:**\n- You can prepare these ahead of time and freeze them before baking. Bake directly from frozen, adding a few extra minutes to the baking time.\n- Pair them with Middle Eastern-inspired drinks like mint lemonade (limonana) or pomegranate juice for an authentic touch.\n\nEnjoy hosting and impressing your guests with this Israeli favorite!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1249, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1240, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1233, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1249, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2624, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1240, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2334, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1233, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2681, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2283, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2279, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2725}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 45, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 42, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 52, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 59, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 47, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 57}, "total_time": [48.19631218910217], "llm_time": {"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.250042915344238, 7.277669906616211], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [10.34597396850586, 7.9904069900512695], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [18.606512784957886, 28.16625189781189], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [12.721261978149414]}, "llm_tokens": {"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [85, 85], "completion": [636, 592], "total": [721, 677]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [79, 79], "completion": [651, 567], "total": [730, 646]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [53, 53], "completion": [572, 690], "total": [625, 743]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [57], "completion": [660], "total": [717]}}}

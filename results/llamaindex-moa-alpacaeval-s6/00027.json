When someone is sick, comforting, nutritious, and easy-to-digest foods are usually best. Here are some great options you can prepare for her:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Chicken Soup**\nClassic and comforting, chicken soup is hydrating and packed with nutrients. Its warmth can soothe a sore throat, and the broth helps replenish fluids. Add vegetables like carrots, celery, and onions for extra vitamins.\n\n**Pro Tip:** If she's vegetarian, substitute the chicken with tofu or lentils and use vegetable broth.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Ginger Tea**\nGinger has anti-inflammatory and nausea-relieving properties. Brew some fresh ginger tea with a little honey and lemon. It's soothing and helps boost her immune system.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Oatmeal**\nOatmeal is gentle on the stomach and easy to digest. Cook it with water or milk and add toppings like banana slices, a drizzle of honey, or cinnamon for flavor and nutrients.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Mashed Sweet Potatoes**\nSweet potatoes are rich in vitamins like A and C, which are great for immunity. Mash them up to make them easy to eat and add a little butter or olive oil for flavor.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Applesauce**\nUnsweetened applesauce is mild, hydrating, and easy on the stomach. It's particularly good if she's dealing with nausea or an upset stomach.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Rice and Steamed Vegetables**\nA simple dish of plain rice and lightly steamed veggies (like carrots or zucchini) is gentle and nutrient-rich. You can also serve it with a small amount of soy sauce or broth for flavor.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Toast or Crackers**\nIf she's feeling queasy, plain toast or crackers can be a good option. They\u2019re bland and easy on the stomach, but they can still provide energy.\n\n---\n\n### **8. Smoothies**\nBlend fruits like bananas, berries, and spinach with yogurt, milk, or a non-dairy alternative. Smoothies are hydrating, packed with nutrients, and easy to sip.\n\n---\n\n### **9. Herbal Tea with Honey**\nPeppermint, chamomile, or lemon tea can be soothing and hydrating. Add honey for sweetness and throat relief.\n\n---\n\n### **10. Broth-Based Soups**\nIf chicken soup isn\u2019t an option, try making a simple vegetable broth or miso soup. The warm liquid can ease her throat and provide hydration.\n\n---\n\n### **11. Bananas**\nBananas are gentle on the stomach, easy to digest, and high in potassium, which can help replenish electrolytes if she's dehydrated.\n\n---\n\n### **12. Scrambled Eggs**\nLightly scrambled eggs are a great source of protein and are easy to digest. Pair them with a slice of toast if she feels up for it.\n\n---\n\n### **13. Popsicles or Ice Cream**\nIf she has a sore throat, popsicles or a small scoop of ice cream can be soothing. Opt for fruit-based popsicles or dairy-free versions if she has dietary preferences.\n\n---\n\n### **Foods to Avoid:**\n- **Spicy or acidic foods** (can irritate her stomach or throat)\n- **Greasy or heavy meals** (harder to digest)\n- **Dairy** (if she's congested; it could thicken mucus for some people)\n\n---\n\nMake sure she stays hydrated with plenty of water, herbal tea, or electrolyte drinks.

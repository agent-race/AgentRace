Fl\u00e6skesteg is a classic Danish dish, often served during Christmas, but it's also a fantastic choice for hosting guests any time of year. It\u2019s a roast pork dish featuring crispy crackling that\u2019s sure to impress your guests. Here's how you can make it:\n\n---\n\n### **Fl\u00e6skesteg (Danish Roast Pork with Crackling)**\n**Serves:** 6-8  \n**Prep Time:** 15 minutes  \n**Cook Time:** 1.5\u20132 hours  \n\n---\n\n#### **Ingredients**\n- 1.5\u20132 kg (3\u20134 lbs) pork loin or pork shoulder with the rind (skin) on\n- 1 tablespoon coarse sea salt\n- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n- 3\u20134 bay leaves\n- 2\u20133 cups water\n- Optional: 1\u20132 onions, halved\n- Optional: 2\u20133 carrots, roughly chopped\n\n---\n\n#### **For Serving (Traditional Sides)**\n- Red cabbage (R\u00f8dk\u00e5l)\n- Boiled or caramelized potatoes\n- Gravy (made from the pan drippings)\n\n---\n\n### **Instructions**\n1. **Prepare the Pork:**\n   - Preheat your oven to 230\u00b0C (450\u00b0F).\n   - Use a sharp knife to cut slits into the pork rind, about 1 cm (\u00bd inch) apart. Be careful to cut through the skin and fat but not into the meat.\n   - Rub the entire pork roast generously with coarse sea salt, making sure to get the salt into the slits. Sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper.\n   - Insert bay leaves into a few of the slits for added flavor.\n\n2. **Set Up the Roast:**\n   - Place the pork on a roasting rack in a roasting pan, rind side up. If you don\u2019t have a rack, you can prop the pork up with halved onions or carrots to elevate it slightly.\n   - Pour water into the bottom of the roasting pan so it\u2019s about 1\u20132 cm (\u00bd\u20131 inch) deep. This will keep the meat moist and help create drippings for the gravy.\n\n3. **Roasting:**\n   - Place the roast in the oven and cook at 230\u00b0C (450\u00b0F) for 15\u201320 minutes to help the rind begin to crisp.\n   - Reduce the oven temperature to 200\u00b0C (400\u00b0F) and continue roasting for 1.5\u20132 hours, depending on the size of the roast. Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature\u2014it should reach 65\u201370\u00b0C (150\u2013160\u00b0F) when done.\n\n4. **Achieving Perfect Crackling:**\n   - If the crackling (the crispy pork skin) hasn\u2019t fully crisped during cooking, you can turn the oven to broil for the final 5\u201310 minutes. Keep a close eye on it to prevent burning.\n\n5. **Rest the Roast:**\n   - Remove the pork from the oven and let it rest for 10\u201315 minutes before slicing. This allows the juices to redistribute.\n\n6. **Make the Gravy:**\n   - While the pork is resting, pour the drippings from the roasting pan into a saucepan. Skim off excess fat.\n   - Bring to a simmer and thicken with a slurry of flour and water, or add cream for a richer gravy. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\n\n7. **Serve:**\n   - Slice the pork into 1 cm (\u00bd inch) thick slices, ensuring each piece has a bit of crispy crackling on top.\n   - Serve with red cabbage, potatoes (boiled or caramelized), and the gravy.\n\n---\n\n### **Tips for Success**\n- **Crispy Crackling:** The key to perfect crackling is ensuring the skin is dry before cooking. You can pat it dry with paper towels beforehand or leave the pork uncovered in the fridge for a few hours to dry out.\n- **Flavor Variations:** You can add other spices like thyme or garlic to the slits along with the bay leaves for a more aromatic roast.\n\n---\n\nEnjoy your Fl\u00e6skesteg! It\u2019s a hearty and flavorful dish that will leave your guests raving.

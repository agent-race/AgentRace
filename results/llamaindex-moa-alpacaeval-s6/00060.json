Walt Disney, one of the most influential figures in the entertainment industry, is renowned for revolutionizing animation and building a global empire of imagination and creativity. Below is an overview of his life and legacy:\n\n### Early Life\n**Walter Elias Disney** was born on **December 5, 1901**, in **Chicago, Illinois**, to Elias Disney and Flora Call Disney. He was one of five children. When Walt was four years old, the family moved to a farm in Marceline, Missouri. This idyllic rural setting later influenced much of Walt\u2019s creative work, including the design of Disneyland\u2019s Main Street, U.S.A.\n\nFrom a young age, Walt demonstrated an interest in art and drawing. He sold sketches to neighbors and took art classes while attending high school in Kansas City, Missouri. After briefly serving as an ambulance driver in France during World War I, Walt returned to Kansas City, where he pursued a career in commercial art.\n\n### Early Career and Laugh-O-Gram Studios\nIn the early 1920s, Walt partnered with Ub Iwerks, a talented animator, and founded a company called **Laugh-O-Gram Studios** in Kansas City. The company produced short animated films based on fairy tales, but financial difficulties led to its closure.\n\nUndeterred, Walt moved to **Hollywood, California**, in 1923. He and his brother **Roy O. Disney** founded the **Disney Brothers Studio**, which later became **The Walt Disney Company**. Their first major success came with the creation of a character named **Oswald the Lucky Rabbit**, but Walt lost the rights to the character due to a contract dispute with his distributor.\n\n### The Birth of Mickey Mouse\nDetermined to create a new character, Walt collaborated with Ub Iwerks to develop **Mickey Mouse**. Mickey made his debut in **\"Steamboat Willie\"** (1928), one of the first synchronized sound cartoons. The character became an instant sensation and established Disney as a major player in animation.\n\n### Innovations in Animation\nDisney continued to push boundaries in animation. In 1929, the company launched the **Silly Symphonies** series, which featured innovative uses of music and synchronized sound. One of its most famous shorts, **\"The Skeleton Dance\"** (1929), demonstrated Disney's creativity and technical prowess.\n\nIn 1937, Walt Disney released **\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\"** the first-ever full-length animated feature film. Despite skepticism from Hollywood insiders, the film was a massive commercial and critical success. It earned an Academy Honorary Award and paved the way for future animated classics.\n\n### Expansion and Disneyland\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, Disney released a series of iconic animated films, including **\"Pinocchio\" (1940)**, **\"Fantasia\" (1940)**, **\"Dumbo\" (1941)**, and **\"Bambi\" (1942)**. He also expanded into live-action films, producing classics like **\"Treasure Island\" (1950)** and **\"Mary Poppins\" (1964).**\n\nWalt had a vision for a theme park where families could experience the magic of Disney firsthand. In **1955**, he opened **Disneyland** in Anaheim, California. The park was groundbreaking, featuring immersive attractions and storytelling that captivated visitors of all ages. Disneyland's success led to the creation of Disney theme parks around the world.\n\n### Later Years and Legacy\nIn the 1960s, Walt began working on plans for **Walt Disney World**, a massive entertainment complex in Florida. He envisioned it as more than just a theme park\u2014it would include an experimental community called the **Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow (EPCOT).**\n\nOn **December 15, 1966**, Walt Disney passed away from lung cancer at the age of 65. Though he did not live to see Walt Disney World completed, his brother Roy oversaw its opening in **1971**.\n\n### Lasting Impact\nWalt Disney\u2019s legacy continues to thrive through The Walt Disney Company, which has grown into one of the largest media and entertainment conglomerates in the world.

Milanesa de Peceto is a classic Argentinian dish that's simple, delicious, and perfect for hosting. It's a breaded and fried beef cutlet, comparable to schnitzel, and is often served with a side of mashed potatoes, salad, or fries. Here's a recipe for you to try:\n\n---\n\n### **Milanesa de Peceto Recipe**\n\n#### **Ingredients** (Serves 4)\n- **1 lb (500g) peceto (eye of round)** or another thin, lean cut of beef\n- **2 cups breadcrumbs** (preferably seasoned, or add your own seasoning)\n- **2 large eggs**\n- **1/4 cup milk**\n- **1/2 cup all-purpose flour**\n- **3-4 garlic cloves**, minced\n- **2 tbsp fresh parsley**, finely chopped\n- **Salt and black pepper**, to taste\n- **Vegetable oil** (for frying)\n- Optional: Lemon wedges for serving\n\n---\n\n#### **Instructions**\n\n1. **Prepare the Meat:**\n   - Slice the peceto into thin, even slices (about 1/4 inch thick). If needed, pound the slices gently with a meat mallet to tenderize and thin them further.\n   - Season both sides of the meat slices with salt and black pepper.\n\n2. **Make the Egg Mixture:**\n   - In a shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, minced garlic, parsley, and a pinch of salt and pepper.\n\n3. **Prepare the Breading Station:**\n   - Place the flour in one shallow dish.\n   - Place the egg mixture in a second shallow dish.\n   - Place the breadcrumbs in a third shallow dish.\n\n4. **Bread the Meat:**\n   - Dredge each slice of meat in the flour, coating both sides lightly. Shake off any excess.\n   - Dip the floured meat into the egg mixture, ensuring it's fully coated.\n   - Finally, press the meat into the breadcrumbs, coating both sides evenly and firmly. Set the breaded slices on a plate or tray.\n\n5. **Fry the Milanesas:**\n   - Heat about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. The oil should be hot but not smoking (around 350\u00b0F/175\u00b0C).\n   - Fry the milanesas in batches, cooking for about 2-3 minutes per side or until golden brown and crispy. Avoid overcrowding the pan.\n   - Remove the cooked milanesas and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil.\n\n6. **Serve:**\n   - Serve the milanesas hot, garnished with lemon wedges. Pair them with mashed potatoes, a fresh salad, or crispy fries for a complete meal.\n\n---\n\n### **Tips for Success**\n- For extra flavor, you can add grated Parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs.\n- If you'd like to bake instead of fry, place the breaded milanesas on a greased baking sheet and bake at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway through.\n- To make \"Milanesa a la Napolitana,\" top the fried milanesas with tomato sauce, ham, and melted cheese, and bake briefly in the oven.\n\n---\n\nThis dish is beloved in Argentina and is sure to be a hit with your guests.

Here's a basic recipe to help you get started:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 24 canned or jarred escargot (snails), drained and rinsed\n- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened\n- 4 cloves garlic, minced\n- 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley\n- 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh chives (optional)\n- 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh tarragon (optional)\n- 1 teaspoon lemon juice\n- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste\n- 24 snail shells or a special escargot baking dish\n- Baguette slices, for serving\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Preheat Oven:**\n   - Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n\n2. **Prepare Garlic Herb Butter:**\n   - In a bowl, combine the softened butter, minced garlic, parsley, chives, tarragon, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are fully incorporated.\n\n3. **Fill the Snail Shells:**\n   - If using snail shells, place a small amount of the garlic herb butter inside each shell, add a snail, and then pack more butter on top to seal. If using an escargot dish, place a small amount of butter in each compartment, add a snail, and cover with more butter.\n\n4. **Bake:**\n   - Arrange the filled snail shells or the escargot dish on a baking sheet to catch any butter that might overflow. Bake in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until the butter is bubbly and the snails are heated through.\n\n5. **Serve:**\n   - Serve the escargot hot with slices of baguette to soak up the flavorful butter.\n\n### Tips:\n- If you don't have snail shells, you can use mushroom caps as an alternative.\n- Make sure your butter is well-seasoned since it imparts most of the flavor to the escargot.\n- Experiment with different herbs to tailor the dish to your taste preferences.\n\nEnjoy your homemade escargot with a glass of white wine for an authentic French dining experience!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1037, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1028, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1021, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1037, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2319, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1028, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2537, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1021, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2610, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2766, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2781, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2206}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 34, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 50, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 40, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 57, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 68, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 55}, "total_time": [54.888205766677856], "llm_time": {"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.617105007171631, 7.110443830490112], "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.425652027130127, 5.640177965164185], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [27.986567974090576, 26.43993902206421], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [22.999249935150146]}, "llm_tokens": {"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [43, 43], "completion": [555, 616], "total": [598, 659]}, "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [37, 37], "completion": [661, 717], "total": [698, 754]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [11, 11], "completion": [747, 600], "total": [758, 611]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [15], "completion": [459], "total": [474]}}}

Here are some tips to help you properly care for your wooden table:\n\n### 1. **Regular Cleaning**\n   - **Dust Often:** Use a soft, dry, lint-free cloth or microfiber cloth to remove dust regularly. Dust particles can accumulate and scratch the surface over time.\n   - **Wipe with a Damp Cloth:** Use a damp (not wet) cloth to clean the surface. Avoid soaking the wood, as too much moisture can cause warping or damage.\n   - **Mild Soap Solution:** For stubborn dirt, mix a small amount of mild dish soap with warm water. Dampen a cloth with the solution, wipe the table, and dry it immediately with a clean, dry cloth.\n\n### 2. **Protect the Surface**\n   - **Use Coasters and Placemats:** Prevent rings and stains by using coasters under glasses and placemats under plates.\n   - **Avoid Direct Heat:** Place hot dishes on trivets or heat-resistant pads to prevent heat damage or scorch marks.\n   - **Protect Against Spills:** Wipe up spills immediately to prevent liquid from seeping into the wood and causing stains or swelling.\n\n### 3. **Polishing and Conditioning**\n   - **Use Wood Polish or Wax:** Apply a high-quality wood polish, wax, or furniture oil occasionally (every few months) to maintain the table's shine and prevent it from drying out.\n   - **Match the Finish:** Be sure to use a product compatible with the finish of your table (e.g., lacquered, oiled, or varnished).\n   - **Avoid Silicone-Based Polishes:** These can leave a residue that builds up over time.\n\n### 4. **Prevent Scratches**\n   - **Use Felt Pads:** Attach felt pads to the bottom of items placed on the table (like lamps or decorative objects) to prevent scratches.\n   - **Avoid Dragging Items:** Lift objects instead of sliding them across the surface.\n   - **Trim Pets\u2019 Nails:** If you have pets, keep their nails trimmed to avoid accidental scratches.\n\n### 5. **Avoid Sun and Moisture Damage**\n   - **Limit Sun Exposure:** Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can cause fading or discoloration. Use curtains, blinds, or UV-blocking window films if the table is near a window.\n   - **Control Humidity:** Keep the table in a room with stable humidity levels (ideally 40-45%) to prevent the wood from expanding, contracting, or cracking. Use a humidifier or dehumidifier if necessary.\n\n### 6. **Repairing Minor Damage**\n   - **Fix Scratches:** Use a wood touch-up pen, crayon, or marker in a matching color to conceal minor scratches.\n   - **Remove Water Rings:** Lightly buff out water rings with a mixture of baking soda and water or use a specialized furniture cleaner.\n   - **Refinish When Necessary:** If the table's finish becomes dull or damaged, consider refinishing it. Sand off the old finish, apply a new stain or paint, and reseal with a protective topcoat.\n\n### 7. **Avoid Harsh Chemicals**\n   - Do not use ammonia-based cleaners, abrasive sponges, or harsh chemicals that can damage the wood or its finish.\n\nBy following these steps, you can preserve your wooden table\u2019s beauty, functionality, and longevity.", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1051, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1042, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1035, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1051, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2518, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1042, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 3175, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1035, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2632, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2581, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2285, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 2126}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 40, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 30, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 28, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 38, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 44, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 36}, "total_time": [30.06797695159912], "llm_time": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [4.622819185256958, 4.273116111755371], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.574197053909302, 5.788441896438599], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [14.56455111503601, 13.479755878448486], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [10.969256162643433]}, "llm_tokens": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [39, 39], "completion": [563, 558], "total": [602, 597]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [45, 45], "completion": [663, 539], "total": [708, 584]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [13, 13], "completion": [529, 495], "total": [542, 508]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [17], "completion": [707], "total": [724]}}}

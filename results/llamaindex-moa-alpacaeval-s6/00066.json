Here's a simple recipe to make frosting using Crisco:\n\n### Ingredients\n- 1 cup Crisco shortening\n- 4 cups powdered sugar (confectioner's sugar)\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n- 4 tablespoons milk or water\n- A pinch of salt (optional)\n- Food coloring (optional)\n\n### Instructions\n\n1. **Prepare Your Mixer:**\n   - In a large mixing bowl, place the Crisco shortening. It's helpful to use a stand mixer or hand mixer for this recipe.\n\n2. **Cream the Shortening:**\n   - Beat the Crisco on medium speed until it becomes smooth and creamy.\n\n3. **Add Vanilla Extract and Salt:**\n   - Add the vanilla extract and a pinch of salt (if using). Continue to mix until well incorporated.\n\n4. **Gradually Add Sugar:**\n   - Slowly add the powdered sugar, one cup at a time, mixing on low speed to prevent a sugar cloud. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.\n\n5. **Add Milk or Water:**\n   - Gradually add the milk or water, one tablespoon at a time, until you reach the desired consistency. You may use more or less than 4 tablespoons depending on how thick or thin you want the frosting.\n\n6. **Mix Until Fluffy:**\n   - Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat the mixture until it's light and fluffy. This usually takes about 3-5 minutes.\n\n7. **Color (Optional):**\n   - If you want colored frosting, add a few drops of food coloring and mix until evenly distributed.\n\n8. **Use or Store:**\n   - Your frosting is now ready to use. Spread it on cakes, cupcakes, or cookies. If not using immediately, store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days or refrigerate for up to a week. Allow refrigerated frosting to come to room temperature and re-whip before using.\n\n### Tips\n- **Consistency Adjustment:** If the frosting is too thick, add a bit more milk or water. If it's too thin, add more powdered sugar.\n- **Flavor Variations:** Experiment with different extracts like almond, lemon, or peppermint for a unique twist.\n- **Storage:** If you plan to store the frosting, make sure it's in an airtight container to prevent it from drying out.\n\nThis simple recipe can be adapted to suit your flavor and color preferences, making it a versatile choice for any baking project!", "tools": {}, "retrieve_time": [], "rerank_time": [], "communication_size": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 1046, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 1037, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 1030, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 1046, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 2270, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 1037, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 2442, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 1030, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 2544, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 2149, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 1949, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 2110}, "communication_pack": {"Root Agent_to_Agent 1": 898, "Root Agent_to_Agent 2": 889, "Root Agent_to_Agent 3": 882, "Root Agent_to_Agent 4": 898, "Agent 2_to_Root Agent": 38, "Root Agent_to_Agent 5": 889, "Agent 1_to_Root Agent": 43, "Root Agent_to_Agent 6": 882, "Agent 4_to_Root Agent": 40, "Agent 5_to_Root Agent": 39, "Agent 6_to_Root Agent": 41, "Agent 3_to_Root Agent": 43}, "total_time": [30.734276056289673], "llm_time": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.333861827850342, 4.812327861785889], "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": [5.376027822494507, 5.581784009933472], "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": [12.123664140701294, 18.703794956207275], "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": [12.002922058105469]}, "llm_tokens": {"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [36, 36], "completion": [519, 469], "total": [555, 505]}, "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo": {"prompt": [42, 42], "completion": [559, 584], "total": [601, 626]}, "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3": {"prompt": [10, 10], "completion": [499, 548], "total": [509, 558]}, "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": {"prompt": [14], "completion": [516], "total": [530]}}}
